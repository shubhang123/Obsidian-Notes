# Bajaj Finserv Campus Placement Process for Software Development Roles

**Bajaj Finserv** (including divisions like Bajaj Finserv Health) conducts a multi-stage campus recruitment drive for software development positions. The process typically spans several rounds, starting from online assessments to technical interviews and an HR discussion. Below is a detailed, up-to-date overview of the placement process, including round-wise breakdown, question patterns, example questions with difficulty, a list of important practice problems by topic, common HR questions, and other useful insights.

## Selection Process Overview

Bajaj Finserv’s campus hiring process generally consists of **4 rounds**, though some drives may have an additional round depending on the role. The typical sequence is as follows ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2022 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2022-2/#:~:text=Selection%20Process%3A%20API%20Challenge%2C%20Coding,with%20Panel%2C%20and%20HR%20Round)) ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=The%20complete%20drive%20consisted%20of,questions%20for%20dif%202%20min)):

- **Round 1 – Online Assignment (API Challenge):** A unique round where candidates perform a task related to APIs or web services (details below). It tests practical coding and problem understanding in a real-world scenario.
    
- **Round 2 – Online Aptitude & Coding Test:** A computer-based test (often on platforms like HackerEarth) combining aptitude/MCQs and coding questions ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2022 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2022-2/#:~:text=Coding%20Assessment%3A%20This%20test%20was,to%20solve%20both%20of%20them)). This assesses CS fundamentals, logical ability, and programming skills.
    
- **Round 3 – Technical Interview(s):** One or two rounds of technical interview with an engineering panel. Focuses on data structures & algorithms, academic concepts, projects, and domain-specific knowledge.
    
- **Round 4 – HR Interview:** A final HR discussion to evaluate the candidate’s personality, communication, and cultural fit. (In some cases, there may be a combined **Technical + Managerial** discussion before the final HR round ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=4th%20round%20,HR%20Interview)).)
    

_Note:_ In certain campus drives, an extra **Group Discussion** or **additional technical round** might be conducted (though this is less common for software roles). For example, one candidate reported an initial Group Discussion round before interviews ([Bajaj Finance Software Developer Interview Questions - Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Bajaj-Finance-Software-Developer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE230765.0,13_KO14,32.htm#:~:text=Campus%20Interview%20First%20they%20Shortlist,that%20but%20my%203)), but most software roles follow the above structure.

## Round 1: API Challenge / Online Assignment

The first round is often an **API-based challenge** or similar hands-on assignment. This is a distinctive part of Bajaj Finserv’s process:

- Candidates are given an **API endpoint or problem statement** and must interact with it according to instructions. In some cases, you need to **make a specific HTTP request (e.g. PUT/POST)** to submit your details (like name, email, college roll no.) to a server ([My Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience — On-campus 2021 | by Aditya Upadhye | Medium](https://aditya-upadhye.medium.com/my-bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2021-8c7e0cbc09d2#:~:text=Written%20Test%201%3A%20This%20was,DSA%20or%20aptitude%20in%20it)). This may involve writing a small script or using tools to send the request along with required data (sometimes even attaching code files in the request). Basic familiarity with using APIs (GET/POST requests, JSON data) is usually sufficient to clear this round ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Round%201%28API%20Challenge%29%3A%20First,API%20given%20by%20the%20company)).
    
- In other scenarios, the challenge might be to **develop and host a simple REST API** yourself. For example, in a 2024 on-campus test, candidates had to build a POST API that accepts an input array of mixed elements and returns a JSON response segregating the array into even numbers, odd numbers, and alphabet characters (letters converted to uppercase), along with the candidate’s own details ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience For Full Stack Engineering (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-for-full-stack-engineering-on-campus/#:~:text=Round%201%3A%20API%20Task%20Explanation)). This required deploying the API (e.g., on a cloud or local server) and sharing the endpoint.
    
- The **evaluation** is typically automated – if your API call/response meets the specification, you pass. Candidates usually have a fixed time window (e.g. 1-2 hours) for this round, but can attempt multiple times within that window to get it right ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2022 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2022-2/#:~:text=API%20challenge%3A%20An%20API%20was,in%20the%20given%20time%20window)). The key is understanding the problem and correctly formatting the request/response.
    

> **Tip:** Prepare by learning basic web-request handling in a language of your choice (Python requests, Java HttpClient, etc.) and simple web framework skills. According to past candidates, “some basic knowledge about API is enough to get through this round” ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Round%201%28API%20Challenge%29%3A%20First,API%20given%20by%20the%20company)). Pay close attention to the problem details (endpoints, data format) and test your solution thoroughly within the given time.

## Round 2: Online Aptitude and Coding Test

After the API round, shortlisted students appear for an **online test** that combines aptitude questions (MCQs) and coding problems. This round is usually conducted on a platform like **HackerEarth or HackerRank**, under proctored conditions ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2022 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2022-2/#:~:text=Coding%20Assessment%3A%20This%20test%20was,to%20solve%20both%20of%20them)).

**Test Pattern:**

- **Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs):** Typically 10–20 MCQs covering a mix of:
    
    - **Aptitude & Reasoning:** Basic quantitative aptitude (math), logical reasoning, and sometimes simple puzzles.
        
    - **Computer Science Fundamentals:** Questions on programming concepts (OOPs, output of code snippets, complexity), databases, operating systems, etc., often related to the **domain** you chose. _For instance, candidates had ~15 MCQs related to the domain (Android, Web, etc.) they applied for, plus a few general CS/logic questions ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Round%202,4%20basic%20reasoning%20questions))._ In one Bajaj Finserv Health test, MCQs were from topics like MongoDB, Java, frontend, backend technologies ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=2nd%20round%20)), reflecting a broad range of CS knowledge.
        
- **Coding Problems:** Usually **2 coding questions** to be solved in code. The difficulty is generally **Easy to Medium**, focusing on algorithms and data structures. Common themes include array manipulations, strings, dynamic programming, etc. Past tests indicate:
    
    - Both questions can be medium-level DSA problems. In a 2021 test, for example, candidates got two DP problems: _“Partition a set into two subsets with minimum sum difference”_ and _“Longest Increasing Subsequence”_ ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,Technical%20interview)). Another test involved array problems (two questions on arrays, easy-medium) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2022 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2022-2/#:~:text=Coding%20Assessment%3A%20This%20test%20was,to%20solve%20both%20of%20them)).
        
    - Sometimes one question may be oriented towards the chosen domain or general development. In a 2024 full-stack role, one coding question was a **greedy algorithm problem** (medium difficulty) and the second required creating a functional **Calculator using HTML/CSS/JS** (to test front-end skills) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience For Full Stack Engineering (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-for-full-stack-engineering-on-campus/#:~:text=In%20this%20round%2C%20candidates%20faced,MCQs%20based%20on%20coding%20subjects)). Similarly, a Finserv Health test had one greedy algorithm question and one frontend-oriented question ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=2nd%20round%20)).
        
- **Time Limit:** The overall duration for this test is around **60 to 90 minutes** (e.g. 1.5 hours in some cases ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience For Full Stack Engineering (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-for-full-stack-engineering-on-campus/#:~:text=Round%202%20,1hr%2030%20minutes))). Managing time between MCQs and coding is crucial.
    
- **Languages:** You can code in popular languages like C++, Java, Python, etc. (the HackerEarth platform supports multiple languages). Choose the one you are most comfortable with for implementation. Ensure you handle input/output format as specified.
    

**Topics to prepare for Round 2:** Data structure basics (arrays, strings, linked lists), algorithms (sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy strategies), and core CS concepts. Also, brush up on any **technology stack** you claimed (Java basics if Java role, web basics if Web role, etc.) because MCQs will probe these areas ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=,algorithm%2C%20and%20one%20frontend%20question)). Practicing output-based questions (predicting code output) in languages like Java/C++ can be useful, as such MCQs have been reported.

> **Tip:** Aim to solve at least one coding question fully (all test cases) and make a reasonable attempt at the second. Past candidates note that solving both questions (or most test cases) significantly improves your chances ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,Technical%20interview)). Since many coding questions are standard problems, practicing a variety of popular interview problems can pay off – _“there are high chances you might encounter a question similar to what you may have already solved before”_ ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Tips%3A%20Both%20questions%20are%20based,may%20have%20already%20solved%20before)).

## Technical Interview Rounds

Candidates who clear the online tests progress to one or more **technical interviews**. Bajaj Finserv typically has **1–2 technical rounds** for campus hires, each about **30–45 minutes** (often conducted virtually). In some drives, there is a single thorough technical interview; in others (e.g., Bajaj Finserv Health) there were two – one purely technical and another mixed with HR/managerial questions ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=3rd%20round%20)).

**What interviewers evaluate:** Your understanding of **data structures and algorithms, computer science fundamentals, academic projects, and problem-solving approach**. They also gauge how well you know the technologies you’ve worked with.

**Common areas and questions:**

- **Resume and Projects:** Expect in-depth discussion on your projects or internships. Be ready to explain your project architecture, the tech stack, challenges faced, and your specific contributions ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,the%20case%20of%20a%20linked)). For example, if you built a web app, you might be asked about how you implemented certain features, any security or performance considerations, etc. One candidate was asked about encryption and hashing in the context of a social network project, how they solved particular problems, and if they worked in a team ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,48%29%2C%20merge%20sort)).
    
- **Data Structures & Algorithms:** Interviewers often pose at least one coding or algorithmic problem for you to solve or explain. This could be a follow-up from your written test or a new problem. Examples include classic problems like **finding a pair with a given sum in an array (Two-sum)** ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=3rd%20round%20)), detecting a loop in a linked list (Floyd’s cycle detection) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,concepts%20in%20real%20life%20and)), or other array/string manipulations. You may not always have to write full code on a compiler, but you should be able to outline your approach, perhaps write pseudocode or work through an example. Efficiency and clarity of thought are important – if you propose an initial solution, they might ask how to optimize it.
    
- **Core CS Concepts:** Expect questions on **OOP concepts, DBMS, OS, and sometimes networking basics.** Interviewers often ask you to explain concepts or differentiate between them. For instance, differences between a HashMap and Hashtable in Java ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,concepts%20in%20real%20life%20and)), explanation of database indexing or SQL vs NoSQL differences ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=3rd%20round%20)), basics of operating systems (process vs thread, memory management), etc. One report mentioned being asked about **cycle detection in a linked list**, and which sorting algorithm is better for linked lists (hint: Merge sort is preferred for linked lists) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,concepts%20in%20real%20life%20and)). The panel may also ask you to relate concepts to real-life or give examples (e.g., explain OOP principles with a real-world analogy).
    
- **Domain-Specific Questions:** If you chose a specialization (like Android, Web, or Microservices) during application, some questions will target that. An Android applicant might get questions on the Android lifecycle, a Web developer might be asked about JavaScript or Node.js (e.g., “explain an AJAX method” or specifics of Node.js usage) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience for Backend Developer (On ...](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-for-backend-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=Bajaj%20Finserv%20Interview%20Experience%20for,How%20would%20you%20define)), and a backend Java role could involve questions on frameworks or APIs. In one instance, a full-stack role interview emphasized knowledge of databases (MongoDB queries) and backend logic ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=3rd%20round%20)).
    
- **Scenario/Design Questions:** Occasionally, interviewers pose open-ended scenario questions to assess design thinking. For example, designing a simple system like a **traffic light controller** was asked in a technical discussion ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=4th%20round%20,HR%20Interview)) – here they likely expected the candidate to break down the problem, identify entities and logic (not heavy system design, but a logical design exercise). Such questions test your problem-solving approach and how you handle ambiguous requirements.
    

Throughout the technical interview, the interviewers may give hints or ask you to refine your answers. They are checking your fundamentals and how you tackle problems more than memorized knowledge.

> **Tip:** **Be clear and confident in your explanations.** One candidate noted the importance of being "very clear about each and every word in your resume" ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Tips%3A)) – if you list a skill or project, expect questions on it. It’s okay not to know something; in that case, explain your thought process or admit unfamiliarity rather than guessing. Interviewers appreciate honesty and a willingness to think aloud. If you get stuck, they might nudge you with hints, so listen carefully and don’t panic ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Tips%3A)). Good communication can sometimes even steer a difficult question into a discussion where you can show how you approach learning.

## HR Interview & Behavioral Questions

The final round is the **HR interview**, which assesses your personality, mindset, and fit for the company’s culture. This round is usually **15–30 minutes** (some candidates had a short 5-10 minute HR chat ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Round%204,a%20telephonic%20interview%20with%20HR)), while others experienced a slightly longer conversational HR round). It might be conducted by an HR representative via video or phone.

**Focus Areas:** Your background, motivations, and soft skills. The HR will likely have your resume and feedback from earlier rounds, and will ask questions to know you better. Common **HR and behavioral questions** include:

- **Tell me about yourself.** (Your introduction, education, and highlights of your profile) ([Bajaj Finserv Health Software Engineer Interview Questions](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Bajaj-Finserv-Health-Software-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE3454374.0,20_KO21,38.htm#:~:text=Questions%20www,project%20you%20worked%20on)).
    
- **Why do you want to join Bajaj Finserv?** (Reasons for interest in the company/role) ([Bajaj Finserv Health Software Engineer Interview Questions](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Bajaj-Finserv-Health-Software-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE3454374.0,20_KO21,38.htm#:~:text=Questions%20www,project%20you%20worked%20on)). Be prepared with an answer that reflects research about the company – e.g., you can mention Finserv’s work culture, the fintech domain excitement, or growth opportunities.
    
- **What are your strengths and weaknesses?** ([Bajaj Finserv Health Software Engineer Interview Questions](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Bajaj-Finserv-Health-Software-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE3454374.0,20_KO21,38.htm#:~:text=Questions%20www,project%20you%20worked%20on)) Give honest strengths that relate to the job (problem-solving, quick learning, teamwork, etc., with examples) and a real weakness that you’re improving on.
    
- **Describe a challenging project or situation you faced and how you handled it.** ([Bajaj Finserv Health Software Engineer Interview Questions](https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Bajaj-Finserv-Health-Software-Engineer-Interview-Questions-EI_IE3454374.0,20_KO21,38.htm#:~:text=Questions%20www,project%20you%20worked%20on)) The HR wants to see your problem-solving and resilience in action. You can use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answer.
    
- **Where do you see yourself in 5 years?** or **What are your career goals?** A typical question to understand your ambition and whether it aligns with the company.
    
- **Are you willing to relocate?** (Bajaj Finserv’s tech roles are often in Pune or other locations) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,internship%20offer%20for%20BAJAJ%20Finserv)). The expected answer is usually yes, if you’re okay with the job location. They may also ask if you are comfortable with the bond or service agreement if any (some companies have it; clarify if applicable).
    
- **Personal background questions:** e.g., _“Where have you been living and where is your home?”_ ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=5th%20round%20)) or questions about your family, to break the ice or know you informally.
    
- **Hypothetical or behavioral scenarios:** “How would you work in a team?”, “Tell us about a time you showed leadership,” or “How do you handle tight deadlines or pressure?” – these evaluate your soft skills and work ethic.
    
- **Any questions for us?** Almost always, HR will let you ask them questions. It’s good to ask something thoughtful (about job role, growth path, or company culture).
    

Often, the HR round is friendly and conversational. The HR is checking your communication skills, confidence, and whether you’ll be a good fit in the company’s environment. They may also discuss the **role, salary, training period, or bond** if applicable, and gauge your interest and understanding of these.

> **Tip:** In HR interviews, **be honest and positive**. Show enthusiasm for the role and confidence in yourself. Maintain good body language and be polite. It’s fine to take a moment to think before answering introspective questions. Previous candidates suggest not to “sugar coat” too much – be genuine in your answers ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,internship%20offer%20for%20BAJAJ%20Finserv)). For questions about weaknesses or failures, emphasize what you learned or how you’re improving. Finally, always thank the interviewer for the opportunity at the end.

- **What do you know about our company?** (Shows your preparation and interest)
    
- **Do you have any questions for me/us?** (Always have a couple of smart questions to ask the interviewer.)
    

These questions cover the typical themes: introduction, motivation, strengths/weaknesses, teamwork, conflict resolution, and future plans. Practicing answers to these will help you be more confident in the HR round.

## Sample Coding Questions from Previous Drives (with Difficulty)

Bajaj Finserv has been known to repeat or echo certain coding problems in their assessments. Here are some **actual questions** or very similar problems that have been asked in Bajaj Finserv campus placements, along with their difficulty level:

- **Partition Array into Two Subsets (Minimize Sum Difference)** – _Medium._ Given a set of numbers, partition it into two subsets such that the difference of their sums is minimum. (Dynamic programming solution) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,Technical%20interview)).
    
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence** – _Medium._ Find the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence in an array of integers. (Classic DP problem) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=%2A%201st%20Question%20%E2%80%93%20https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geeksforgeeks.org%2Fpartition,best%20knowledge%20and%20was%20selected)).
    
- **Two-Sum (Pair Sum) Problem** – _Easy._ Given an array and a target sum, determine if any two numbers in the array add up to the target (and possibly return their indices). Asked in interviews as a quick problem-solving test ([Bajaj Finserv Health ltd. Interview Experience For Full Stack Developer (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-health-ltd-interview-experience-for-full-stack-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=3rd%20round%20)).
    
- **Greedy Algorithm Challenge** – _Medium._ A problem that requires a greedy strategy to solve. For example, an interval scheduling problem (selecting maximum non-overlapping intervals) or coin change (making change with minimum coins). One of the coding rounds explicitly featured a greedy algorithm question ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience For Full Stack Engineering (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-for-full-stack-engineering-on-campus/#:~:text=subjects)).
    
- **Implement a Calculator (Frontend)** – _Medium._ Create a functional calculator using HTML/CSS/JS that can perform basic arithmetic operations. This was asked to test front-end programming skills in a coding round ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience For Full Stack Engineering (On-Campus) | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-for-full-stack-engineering-on-campus/#:~:text=subjects)).
    
- **Detect Cycle in a Linked List** – _Easy._ Determine if a linked list contains a cycle (loop) and possibly find the starting node of the loop. (Can be solved with Floyd’s cycle-finding algorithm) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,concepts%20in%20real%20life%20and)).
    
- **Special Sum of Array** – _Easy._ Compute a special sum defined for an array of single-digit integers (problem specifics involve repeatedly summing or combining the digits as described in the question). This problem was reported in a Finserv test ([Nielsen Interview Questions: Make 2 lists a=[1,2,3,4] b=[9,8,5,5,2,3,3 ...](https://www.ambitionbox.com/interviews/nielsen-question/make-2-lists-a1234b985523341110923410109778write-a-program-to-remove-duplicate-of-b-and-keep-only-those-elements-of-b-which-are-not-present-in-a-and-the-final-list-should-be-FcVHKbew#:~:text=Nielsen%20Interview%20Questions%3A%20Make%202,have%20a%20pandas%20dataframe)).
    
- **Alien Dictionary** – _Hard._ Given a sorted dictionary of an alien language, determine the order of characters (i.e., find the alphabet sequence). This is a graph/topological sort problem and was noted among top questions asked to Finserv candidates ([10+ Bajaj Finserv Software Developer Interview Questions & Answers](https://www.ambitionbox.com/interviews/bajaj-finserv-interview-questions/software-developer#:~:text=Answers%20www,provided%20with%20a%20sorted%20diction)).
    

Each of the above problems touches on different algorithms (dynamic programming, greedy, graph, etc.). It’s important to not just memorize solutions but understand the approaches, since the actual question in the exam could be a variation. For instance, the “partition array” problem might appear as a subset-sum variant, or “two-sum” could be framed as finding if any two transactions sum to a given value, etc. Practicing these will give you a strong foundation.

## Important Coding Topics and Practice Problems

To crack the coding rounds of Bajaj Finserv, you should be comfortable with a broad range of **data structures and algorithms problems**. Below is a curated list of **30+ important coding problems**, categorized by topic, that are frequently asked in coding interviews (and very relevant to Bajaj Finserv’s test patterns). Many of these are classic problems or have appeared in similar forms in placement drives:

### Arrays

- **Two Sum** – Find two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target (using hashing for efficiency).
    
- **Maximum Subarray (Kadane’s Algorithm)** – Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
    
- **Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag Problem)** – Given an array with values 0,1,2 (or similar categories), sort it in a single pass (partitioning logic).
    
- **Merge Intervals** – Given a set of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.
    
- **Subarray with Given Sum** – Find a contiguous subarray that adds up to a given sum (or report none). _(Variants: find if such subarray exists, or find all such subarrays.)_
    

### Strings

- **Check Anagram** – Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other (by character frequency count).
    
- **Palindrome Check** – Check if a given string (or number) reads the same backward and forward.
    
- **Longest Palindromic Substring** – Find the longest substring of a given string that is a palindrome (expand-around-center or DP approach).
    
- **First Non-Repeating Character** – In a string, find the first character that does not repeat.
    
- **Substring Search** – Find if a smaller string is a substring of a larger string (implement a naive search or KMP for better efficiency).
    

### Linked Lists

- **Reverse a Linked List** – Iteratively or recursively reverse a singly linked list.
    
- **Detect Loop in Linked List** – Use Floyd’s cycle detection to check for cycles (and find the loop start if needed).
    
- **Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists** – Merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted list (a fundamental merge operation).
    
- **Find Middle of Linked List** – Use slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle node in one pass.
    
- **Remove N-th Node from End** – Remove the N-th node from the end of the list (requires finding list length or two-pointer technique).
    

### Stacks and Queues

- **Valid Parentheses** – Check if an expression has balanced parentheses (using a stack to match brackets).
    
- **Next Greater Element** – For each element in an array, find the next greater element to its right (stack-based solution).
    
- **Min Stack** – Design a stack that can return the minimum element in O(1) time in addition to push/pop (requires auxiliary structure).
    
- **Implement Queue using Stacks** (or vice versa) – Use two stacks to create a queue that supports enqueue and dequeue (and understand the cost of operations).
    

### Trees

- **Binary Tree Traversals** – Perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals of a binary tree (both recursively and iteratively with a stack).
    
- **Level Order Traversal (Breadth-First)** – Traverse a binary tree level by level (using a queue).
    
- **Height of a Binary Tree** – Compute the maximum depth/height of a binary tree (recursive DFS).
    
- **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)** – Find the lowest common ancestor of two nodes in a binary tree (various approaches for BST vs general BT).
    
- **Validate Binary Search Tree** – Check if a binary tree is a valid BST (inorder traversal should be sorted, or use min/max bounds recursively).
    
- **Diameter of Binary Tree** – Find the longest path between any two nodes in a tree (may or may not pass through root).
    

### Graphs

- **Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)** – Implement Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search on a graph (important for understanding connectivity).
    
- **Connected Components** – Find connected components in an undirected graph (using DFS/BFS, union-find).
    
- **Cycle Detection in Graph** – Detect if there is a cycle in a graph (different approaches for directed vs undirected graphs).
    
- **Topological Sort** – Given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), produce a topological ordering of its nodes (Kahn’s algorithm or DFS). _(This is useful for problems like the Alien Dictionary above.)_
    
- **Shortest Path in Unweighted Graph** – Use BFS to find the shortest path (in terms of edge count) between two nodes in an unweighted graph.
    

### Dynamic Programming

- **Fibonacci / Climbing Stairs** – Compute nth Fibonacci number or number of ways to climb stairs (basic DP starter problem).
    
- **0/1 Knapsack Problem** – Given weights and values, maximize value within a weight limit (classic DP).
    
- **Coin Change (Min Coins)** – Given coin denominations, find the minimum number of coins to make a target amount (or count ways to make the amount – two variants of DP).
    
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence** – Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array (DP with binary search optimization is advanced, but DP alone is fine for moderate N).
    
- **Longest Common Subsequence** – Find the length of longest common subsequence between two strings (classic DP on strings).
    
- **Subset Sum / Partition Problem** – Determine if a subset of numbers sums up to a target (subset sum) or split array into two equal-sum subsets (related to the partition DP problem Finserv asked) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=,Technical%20interview)).
    
- **Edit Distance** – Given two strings, find the minimum number of edits (insertions/deletions/replacements) to convert one into the other (DP problem, a bit advanced but a common interview question for string manipulation).
    

### Greedy Algorithms

- **Activity Selection (Interval Scheduling)** – Given start and end times of activities, select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities (greedy by finish times).
    
- **Fractional Knapsack** – Given weights and values of items and a capacity, choose fractions of items to maximize value (greedy by value/weight ratio).
    
- **Job Sequencing with Deadlines** – Given jobs with profits and deadlines, schedule jobs to maximize profit (greedy using sorting by profit and a disjoint set or slot filling).
    
- **Minimum Number of Coins (Coin Change Greedy)** – Find the minimum coins needed for a given amount assuming you can use greedy (works for canonical coin systems like Indian currency).
    
- **Minimum Platforms** – Given train arrival and departure times, find the minimum number of platforms needed so that no train waits (greedy by sorting times).
    
- **Huffman Coding** – Given character frequencies, build Huffman codes (greedy algorithm using a min-heap; a classic problem illustrating greedy choice property).
    

Each topic above is crucial for technical interviews and coding tests. By practicing these problems, you will cover a wide range of techniques. Many questions asked by Bajaj Finserv will be variants or combinations of these fundamental problems. For example, if you’re comfortable with **two-pointer techniques** (used in Two Sum, sorting-based problems) and **dynamic programming** (used in LIS, knapsack, etc.), you’ll be well-equipped for most coding challenges they present.

It’s a good strategy to **simulate timed tests** for yourself with a mix of MCQs and coding, as in Round 2, to build speed and accuracy. Also, refer to interview experiences and problem discussions on GeeksforGeeks/LeetCode for any recent specific questions asked by Bajaj Finserv.

## Additional Tips and Insights

- **Eligibility Criteria:** Bajaj Finserv usually requires a consistent academic record (e.g., **60% throughout** in 10th, 12th, and B.Tech/B.E.) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2023 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2023/#:~:text=%23%20BAJAJ%20FINSERV)). The eligible branches are typically Computer Science, IT, and sometimes Circuit branches for software roles. Ensure you meet the criteria (there’s generally no active backlog allowed during the placement).
    
- **Choice of Domain:** During application or registration, candidates are often asked to choose a preferred domain/track (such as Web Development, Android, Backend, Data Engineering, etc.) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2022 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2022-2/#:~:text=We%20had%20to%20choose%20one,interview%2C%20and%201%20HR%20interview)). This choice will determine some questions in the test and interview. Pick the domain you are strongest in, as you’ll face domain-specific MCQs (and possibly interview questions) on those technologies. For example, choosing _Java Microservices_ might lead to Java-based MCQs, whereas _Web_ might lead to JavaScript/HTML questions.
    
- **Test Platform & Environment:** The online assessments have been conducted on platforms like **HackerEarth** (as reported in 2021–2022 drives) ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience (On-Campus) 2022 | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-on-campus-2022-2/#:~:text=Coding%20Assessment%3A%20This%20test%20was,to%20solve%20both%20of%20them)) and sometimes **HackerRank**. Familiarize yourself with these interfaces – practice coding on them to be comfortable with input-output, using the code editor, etc. Typically, you can compile code during the test and run against sample cases. There is no penalty for wrong submissions, so you can attempt to solve iteratively. The API round might require using a local environment (you can choose any programming language or even tools like Postman for API calls). Ensure you have a good internet connection and a quiet setup for the test and interviews.
    
- **Time Management:** In the aptitude/coding test, manage time between MCQs and coding questions. It might be wise to allocate a fixed block (say 20-30 min) to MCQs then devote the rest to coding. MCQs can fetch easy points quickly – don’t spend too long on any single tricky MCQ; you can mark and revisit if time permits. For coding, read both problems first and start with the one you find easier. Remember to handle corner cases and test your code with sample cases before final submission.
    
- **Language Choice:** Use the programming language you are most comfortable with for coding rounds. C++ and Java are common choices (for their speed and familiarity in campus settings), but Python is acceptable too (just be mindful of optimization, as Python can be slower for large input unless the solution is efficient). All standard languages (C++, Java, Python, C#, etc.) are usually allowed. In web-specific questions (like the HTML/JS one), you’ll need to use the appropriate languages as required by the problem statement.
    
- **Coding Round Strategy:** Aim to **pass all test cases** for at least one problem rather than half-solving both. If stuck on a coding problem, try to at least outline a partial solution or brute force – some test cases passing are better than none. Also, don’t forget that MCQs carry weight too; strong MCQ performance can sometimes compensate if one coding question is only partially solved, since overall score matters.
    
- **Technical Preparation:** Revise important concepts in **OOP (polymorphism, inheritance, etc.), databases (SQL queries, normalization, indexing), and operating systems** (process vs thread, synchronization basics). Bajaj Finserv’s technical grill is not as deeply system-design heavy as some product companies, but they do expect you to know your basics. For instance, be clear on differences between common terms (e.g., processes vs threads, Stack vs Heap memory, abstract class vs interface in Java, etc.). If you mentioned any specific technology (like Node.js, React, Android, etc.), prepare for questions on it – e.g., one candidate was asked to explain an **AJAX call and why Node.js is used** in their project ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience for Backend Developer (On ...](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience-for-backend-developer-on-campus/#:~:text=Bajaj%20Finserv%20Interview%20Experience%20for,How%20would%20you%20define)). Keep handy some fundamental knowledge of the frameworks or languages you list on your resume.
    
- **Mock Interviews:** Practice speaking through problems, as if in an interview. This will help in the technical round when explaining your approach. It’s easy to get nervous, but if you’ve practiced explaining solutions (maybe with a friend or using online mock interview platforms), you’ll perform more calmly. Remember the interview is interactive – if you’re unsure, you can ask clarifying questions or confirm assumptions. Interviewers at Bajaj Finserv were noted to be helpful and would sometimes guide the candidate if they see them thinking in the right direction ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=panic%20no%20matter%20what%20they,So%2C%20do%20not%20panic)).
    
- **Use Hints and Think Aloud:** If an interviewer gives you a hint or asks you to consider a certain case, take that cue and incorporate it. They often want to see your approach more than just the final answer. Thinking aloud (explaining your thought process step by step) can let the interviewer understand your reasoning and help them provide guidance if needed ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=panic%20no%20matter%20what%20they,So%2C%20do%20not%20panic)). It also shows communication skills and clarity.
    
- **Previous Candidate Experiences:** It’s highly beneficial to read others’ interview experiences (like those on GeeksforGeeks, Medium, etc.) for Bajaj Finserv. They often reveal the pattern of questions. For instance, knowing ahead of time that an **API call round** is likely, you can practice that specifically. Similarly, knowing that dynamic programming questions have appeared (like the ones cited earlier) helps you focus your practice. Many candidates have shared that practicing from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, etc., was crucial to their success ([Bajaj Finserv Interview Experience | GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bajaj-finserv-interview-experience/#:~:text=Tips%3A%20Both%20questions%20are%20based,may%20have%20already%20solved%20before)).
    
- **Stay Updated:** Bajaj Finserv is a finance company venturing deep into tech (fintech). It might impress interviewers if you know a bit about their recent tech initiatives (maybe in digital lending platforms, insurance tech, etc.) and casually drop that knowledge in “Why Bajaj Finserv” or other conversations. It shows genuine interest. It’s not required, but it can set you apart in HR discussions.
    
- **During the Process:** Be attentive to instructions given by the recruiting team. For example, ensure you fill any forms (like domain preference, location preference) correctly. For the online tests, join on time and do the required system checks. In case of any glitch in the test (rare, but if it happens), inform the placement cell or proctor immediately and request a rerun – companies usually accommodate genuine cases.
    
- **Post-Interview:** If you’re given the chance, you can send a polite thank-you email (via placement office) to the interviewers, though this is not expected in campus placements. Results may take some time (sometimes announced on the same day, or within a week). Be patient and positive.
    

Lastly, approach the Bajaj Finserv placement process with confidence. The combination of an unusual API round and standard coding+interview rounds is very crackable with good preparation. Practice thoroughly, revise your fundamentals, and you’ll increase your chances of success. Good luck!
