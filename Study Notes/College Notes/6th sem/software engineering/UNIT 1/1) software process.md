## Phased Development Life Cycle:
Product development is a complex and long-running process whose aim is to produce quality S/W products.
Each activity in the process is also referred to as a **phase**.
Each phase in the process again acts as a process for performing the specified activity.
General activities include:
*   **feasibility study,**
*   **analysis,**
*   **design,**
*   **coding,**
*   **testing,**
*   **implementation, and**
*   **maintenance.**
The above activities are collectively called as **Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)** or software life cycle and each of these activities is called Life Cycle Phase.

## Phased Development Life Cycle (Cont.):
Product development is a complex and long-running process whose aim is to produce quality S/W products.
Each **phase has some defined initiating and completion criterion** which produces some kind of intermediate outcomes (work products) for product development.
Examples of these models are waterfall, prototyping, spiral, incremental, agile process, RUP process model, and so on.
Each model begins with customer needs, performs life cycle activities, and ends with some work products.
Each process model has a workflow in which these activities are interrelated to one another.
These activities are undertaken in sequence whereas in other models, activities may be in repeated in a closed loop.
In large and complex projects, activities may be carried out implicitly.

## Phased Life Cycle Activities:
The general development process activities which are covered in software development life cycle models are:
*   **feasibility study,**
*   **requirements analysis,**
*   **design,**
*   **code,**
*   **testing,**
*   **deployment,**
*   **operation, and**
*   **maintenance.**
The developed s/w is:
*   **used in the environment**
*   and **faults may be observed during its operation.**
It is observed that the:
*   **maintenance cost sometimes exceeds with the development cost** due to:
    *   **repeated maintenance,**
    *   **Increased user needs, and**
    *   **rapid growth of technology.**

## SDLC:
A software life cycle model (also termed process model) is a pictorial and diagrammatic representation of the software life cycle. A life cycle model represents all the methods required to make a software product transit through its life cycle stages.

---

## SDLC (Cont.):
In other words, a life cycle model maps the various activities performed on a software product from its inception to retirement.
Without using an exact life cycle model, the development of a software product would not be in a systematic and disciplined manner.
Without software life cycle models, it becomes tough for software project managers to monitor the progress of the project.

## Phased Life Cycle Activities:

### 1. Project Initiation:
It **involves**:
*   **preliminary investigation,**
*   **feasibility study, and**
*   **a project plan.**
**Preliminary Investigation (PI)** is the initial step that gives a clear picture of what the physical system is. PI goes through:
*   **problem identification,**
*   **background of the physical system, and**
*   **the system proposal for a candidate system.**
On the basis of this PI , feasibility study is performed.

### 1. Project Initiation: Feasibility Study
The purpose of feasibility study is to determine whether the implementation of the proposed system will support the mission and objectives of the organization.
It ensures that the candidate system is able to:
*   **satisfy the user needs;**
*   **promotes operational, effective use of resources; and**
*   **is cost effective.**
A feasibility report is prepared and submitted to top-level management.
A positive report leads to project initiation.
A detailed project plan is actually prepared after knowing the requirements.

### 1. Project Initiation: Feasibility Study (Types)
It is classified as:
*   **Technical** (current resources both hardware software along with required technology)
*   **Economical** (Cost/Benefit Analysis)
*   **Legal** (barriers of legal implementation of project, data protection acts or social media laws, project certificate, license, copyright )
*   **Operational feasibility** (how much easy product will be to operate and maintenance after deployment)
*   **Schedule Feasibility** ( timelines/deadlines is analyzed )

### 2. Requirements Analysis:
Process of:
*   **collecting factual data,**
*   **understanding the process involved,**
*   **defining the problem, and**
*   **providing a document for further software development.**

### 2. Requirements Analysis (Activities):
It consists of three main activities:
1.  **Requirements Elicitation**: About understanding the problem
2.  **Requirements Specification**: Requirements Specification Document has been prepared in this described which an SRS is.
3.  **Requirements Verification and Validation**: To check whether the correct requirements are stated (validated) and that these requirements are stated correctly (verification).

### 2. Requirements Analysis: Requirements Elicitation
About understanding the problem.
Activities:
*   Knowledge of the **overall area** where the systems is applied.
*   The **details of the precise customer problem** where the system are going to be applied must be understood.
*   **Interaction** of system with external requirements.
*   Detailed **investigation of user needs**.
*   Define the **constraints** for system development.

### 2. Requirements Analysis: Requirements Elicitation Methods
*   Interviews
*   Brainstorming Sessions
*   Facilitated Application Specification Technique (FAST)
*   Quality Function Deployment (QFD)
*   Use Case Approach

### 2. Requirements Analysis: Requirements Specification
The SRS fully describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform.

### 2. Requirements Analysis: SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
An SRS:
*   **minimizes the time and effort** required by developers to achieve desired goals and also
*   **minimizes the development cost.**
A good SRS defines how an application will interact with system hardware, other programs and human users in a wide variety of real-world situations.
**Alternatives to an SRS:**
*   In **Agile methodologies**, companies usually favor a more lightweight documentation of the requirements, such as via **acceptance tests and user stories.**

### 2. Requirements Analysis: Requirements Specification: The SRS Format
The various types of requirements that are captured during SRS:
1.  **Introduction**
    (i) Purpose of this document
    (ii) Scope of this document
    (iii) Overview
2.  **General description**
3.  **Functional Requirements**
4.  **Interface Requirements**
5.  **Performance Requirements**
6.  **Design Constraints**
7.  **Non-Functional Attributes**
8.  **Preliminary Schedule and Budget**
9.  **Appendices**

### 3. Software Design:
The goal of the design phase is to:
*   **transform the collected requirements into a structure** that
*   **is suitable for implementation in programming languages.**
The S/W designers begin with:
*   **making architectures,**
*   **outlining the hierarchical structure, and**
*   **writing algorithms for each component in the system.**

### 3. Software Design (Aspects):
The **two aspects are**:
*   **physical design or External Design**
*   **logical design or Internal Design**
The logical design is more conceptual and abstract than the physical design.
*   In the logical design, you look at the **logical relationships** among the objects.
*   In the physical design, you look at the most effective way of **storing and retrieving** the objects.

### 4. Coding:
It is concerned with the development of:
*   **source code that will implement the design.**
Good coding efforts can:
*   **reduce testing and maintenance tasks.**
Programs must be modular so that they can help in rapid development, maintenance, and enhancements of the system.
**Rules must be followed** for the declaration of data structures, variables, header files, function call and so on.
Developers have to follow the **coding guidelines** described by their management and programming tools like compilers, interpreters, debuggers, etc. are used to develop and implement the code.

### 5. Testing:
Testing is performed to:
*   **remove the defects** in the developed system.
**Test plan** of the system is developed and run on the specified test data.
Testing covers various errors at the requirements, design, and coding phases.

### 5. Testing (Levels):
Testing is performed at different levels:
*   **unit testing**, carried out for individual modules at the code level
*   **integration testing**, After testing each module, interfaces among various models are checked with integration testing
*   **system testing** ensures that the system satisfies the requirements specified by the customer
*   **acceptance testing** is done for customer satisfaction

### 6. Deployment:
After acceptance by the customer during the testing phase, deployment of the software begins. Once the software is certified, and no bugs or errors are stated, then it is deployed.
The purpose of the software deployment is to make the software available for operational use.
The **release of the software starts.**
Required resources are procured to operate at the customer site and important programs files are loaded onto user’s computer.
After installation of all modules of the system, training of the user starts.

### 6. Deployment (Documentation):
Documentation of the system is also an important activity in software development.
Documentation is in the form of a:
*   **user manual or system operation process** which ensures the continuity of the system.
User documentation is:
*   **the description of the system from the user’s point of view,**
*   **detailing how to use or operate the system.**

### 7. Maintenance:
It comes after the software product is released and put into operation through the deployment process.
Is performed to:
*   **adapt to changes in a new environment,**
*   **correct bugs,**
*   **and enhance the performance by adding new features.**

### 7. Maintenance (Activities):
Its activities can be classified as:
*   **adaptive,** modifying a system in response to environmental changes
*   **perfective,** changing the system so that it can solve new problems or take advantage of new technologies
*   **corrective,** correcting software defects, errors and faults
*   **Preventive,** introducing changes that would protect the system from future problems
