## Umbrella activities
are a crucial set of software engineering actions that **complement** the generic process framework activities. They are distinguished by their **pervasive application**; rather than being confined to specific phases, they are **applied throughout a software project**.

Their primary purpose is to **help a software team manage and control progress, quality, change, and risk**. In essence, they **establish a skeleton architecture for software engineering work**. These activities **overlay the process model** and are **independent of any one specific framework activity**, occurring consistently throughout the entire software development process. They can also be used in conjunction with all other framework activities.

Typical umbrella activities include:

- **Software project tracking and control**: This allows the software team to assess progress against the project plan and take any necessary action to maintain the project.
- **Software configuration management**: This activity manages the effects of change throughout the software process. In the context of the Agile Unified Process (AUP), it specifically addresses change management, risk management, and the control of persistent work products.
- **Risk management**: This helps in understanding and managing uncertainty.
- **Software quality assurance (SQA)**: This ensures that the quality of the software is maintained throughout the process.
- **Reusability management**: This involves defining criteria for work product reuse, including software components, and establishing mechanisms to achieve reusable components.
- **Work product preparation and production**: These encompass the activities required to create various work products such as models, documents, logs, forms, and lists.
- **Measurement**: This activity, along with SQA and SCM, overlays the process model.
- **Domain analysis**: This may also be viewed as an umbrella activity for the software process, being an ongoing activity not connected to any single software project.
