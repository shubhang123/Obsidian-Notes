# 📘 **Software Quality Assurance (SQA) – Detailed Notes**

---

## ✅ 1. **Definition of SQA**

**Software Quality Assurance (SQA)** is a **systematic set of activities** and **processes** aimed at ensuring that the software products and development processes conform to the defined **quality standards**, **procedures**, and **requirements**.

### 📌 Objectives of SQA:

- Ensure the software meets user expectations and business requirements.
    
- Prevent defects rather than detect them later.
    
- Improve software **reliability**, **maintainability**, and **performance**.
    
- Promote **customer satisfaction** through high-quality deliverables.

## 🧩 2. **Core Activities of SQA**

SQA integrates **quality control** and **quality management** throughout the software development lifecycle.

### 🔧 SQA Activities:

1. **Planning** – Define quality standards and practices.
    
2. **Auditing** – Check adherence to defined processes.
    
3. **Code Reviews** – Examine code for quality issues.
    
4. **Inspections & Walkthroughs** – Review software artifacts (design, requirements).
    
5. **Testing** – Conduct unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
    
6. **Defect Management** – Identify, track, and resolve bugs.
    
7. **Verification & Validation (V&V)** – Ensure correctness and completeness.
    
8. **Training & Documentation** – Equip teams with required knowledge and maintain proper records.
    
9. **Change Control** – Manage changes systematically.

## 🧠 3. **Verification vs Validation**

|Concept|Purpose|Question Answered|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Verification**|Ensure that the product is built correctly as per design/specs|_"Are we building the product right?"_|Code review, design inspections|
|**Validation**|Ensure that the built product meets the user’s needs|_"Are we building the right product?"_|User acceptance testing|

---

## 📚 4. **Standards Used in SQA**

Standards help maintain **consistency, traceability**, and **quality assurance**.

### ✳️ Common Standards:

|Standard|Description|
|---|---|
|**ISO 9001**|General quality management system; ensures consistency and improvement.|
|**IEEE 730**|Standard for SQA plans; outlines content, format, and structure.|
|**CMMI**|Capability Maturity Model Integration; evaluates and improves process maturity.|
|**ISO/IEC 25010**|Defines software product quality model (e.g., reliability, security, usability).|

---

## 🧠 5. **Software Quality Attributes**

Quality attributes define **how well** the software performs (non-functional requirements).

|Attribute|Description|
|---|---|
|**Reliability**|Ability to function under defined conditions for a specific time.|
|**Usability**|Ease with which users can learn and use the system.|
|**Efficiency**|Optimal use of system resources (CPU, memory, etc.).|
|**Maintainability**|Ease of identifying and fixing defects or making changes.|
|**Portability**|Ability to run on different environments without modifications.|
|**Testability**|Ease with which software can be tested and verified.|
|**Security**|Protection against unauthorized access or modifications.|
|**Availability**|Degree to which the system is operational and accessible.|
|**Interoperability**|Ability to work with other systems or components.|

---

## 🔁 6. **Continuous Process Improvement in SQA**

SQA encourages **ongoing improvement** of software processes using:

- **PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act)** for iterative process improvement.
    
- **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)** to address recurring defects.
    
- **Kaizen** (continuous small improvements).
    
- **Process maturity models** like **CMMI** for structured growth.
    

---

## 📊 7. **SQA Metrics**

Metrics help **quantify software quality** and monitor progress.

### 🔢 Common SQA Metrics:

|Metric|Description|
|---|---|
|**Defect Density**|Number of defects per 1,000 lines of code (KLOC).|
|**Code Coverage**|% of code executed during testing.|
|**MTTF (Mean Time to Failure)**|Average time the software runs before a failure.|
|**DRE (Defect Removal Efficiency)**|% of defects removed before software release.|
|**Customer Satisfaction Index**|User-reported quality score.|
|**Escaped Defects**|Bugs found after release.|

---

## 📄 8. **Training and Documentation in SQA**

### 🧑‍🏫 **Training:**

- Ensure all team members understand standards, tools, and best practices.
    
- Topics: Testing methods, coding standards, security practices.
    

### 📑 **Documentation:**

- SRS (Software Requirements Specification)
    
- Test Plans and Test Cases
    
- Quality Audits
    
- Change Logs
    
- Configuration and version control records
    

---

## 🧮 9. **Software Quality Factors**

### 📂 Divided into two categories:

### **A. Product Operation Factors** (How the system performs in production)

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|**Correctness**|Degree to which the software meets its functional requirements.|
|**Reliability**|Ability to maintain performance without failure.|
|**Efficiency**|Resource utilization and response times.|
|**Integrity**|Protection from unauthorized access or data breaches.|
|**Usability**|Ease of use and learnability for end users.|

---

### **B. Product Revision & Transition Factors** (Adaptability, maintainability)

|Factor|Description|
|---|---|
|**Maintainability**|Ease of fixing and improving software.|
|**Flexibility**|Ease of adapting to changing requirements.|
|**Testability**|Ease of verifying functionality through tests.|
|**Portability**|Ability to move software to different platforms.|
|**Reusability**|Use of components in other applications.|
|**Interoperability**|Integration with other systems or modules.|

## 🧱 10. **McCall’s Quality Model**

Developed by **Jim McCall**, this model classifies software quality into **three broad perspectives** with **11 quality factors**:

### 🔁 **A. Product Operation**

- **Correctness**
    
- **Reliability**
    
- **Efficiency**
    
- **Integrity**
    
- **Usability**
    

### 🔄 **B. Product Revision**

- **Maintainability**
    
- **Flexibility**
    
- **Testability**
    

### 🔁 **C. Product Transition**

- **Portability**
    
- **Reusability**
    
- **Interoperability**
    

Each of these is tied to specific **metrics** and **criteria** for evaluation.
