# Introduction to Hidden Surface Elimination

Hidden Surface Elimination (HSE), also known as **hidden surface removal** or **visible surface determination**, is a fundamental process in 3D computer graphics used to determine which surfaces of a 3D scene are visible from a given viewpoint and which are occluded (hidden) by other surfaces. This ensures that only the visible parts of objects are rendered, producing a realistic 2D projection of a 3D scene on the screen. Below is a detailed introduction to hidden surface elimination, covering its purpose, challenges, approaches, and basic concepts, with mathematical formulations presented in LaTeX within dollar signs ($).

## Purpose of Hidden Surface Elimination

In 3D rendering, objects are represented as collections of polygons (e.g., triangles) in a 3D space, but the final output is a 2D image viewed from a specific camera or viewpoint. Objects or parts of objects that are behind others (relative to the viewer) should not be visible in the final image. Hidden surface elimination addresses this by:
- **Removing Occluded Surfaces**: Ensuring that surfaces blocked by closer objects are not drawn.
- **Improving Realism**: Producing accurate depth perception in the rendered image.
- **Optimizing Performance**: Reducing unnecessary rendering of hidden geometry to save computational resources.

For example, in a scene with a cube in front of a sphere, the back faces of the cube and parts of the sphere obscured by the cube should not be rendered.

## Challenges in Hidden Surface Elimination

Hidden surface elimination is complex due to:
- **Depth Overlap**: Multiple surfaces may project to the same pixel on the screen, requiring a decision on which is closest.
- **Partial Occlusion**: Surfaces may partially overlap, complicating visibility calculations.
- **Complex Geometries**: Scenes with many polygons or non-convex objects increase computational demands.
- **Viewpoint Dependency**: The visibility of surfaces changes with the camera’s position and orientation.

## Basic Concepts

Hidden surface elimination relies on determining the **depth** (z-coordinate) of surfaces relative to the viewer in a 3D coordinate system. The key idea is to identify which surface is closest to the viewer for each pixel or region of the screen. This involves:
- **Projection**: Transforming 3D coordinates ($ x, y, z $) to 2D screen coordinates ($ x_s, y_s $) via perspective or orthographic projection.
- **Depth Comparison**: Comparing the z-values of surfaces that project to the same screen pixel to determine the visible one.
- **Culling and Clipping**: Eliminating surfaces that are entirely outside the view frustum or facing away from the viewer before detailed processing.

### Mathematical Context
In a 3D scene, objects are defined in a world coordinate system, and the camera is positioned at a point ($ \vec{C} $) with a view direction. After applying a projection transformation (e.g., perspective), a point $ P(x, y, z) $ maps to screen coordinates ($ x_s, y_s $) with an associated depth $ z $. Hidden surface elimination algorithms compare $ z $ values to decide visibility.

For perspective projection, the transformation might be:
\[
$x_s = \frac{f \cdot x}{z}, \quad y_s = \frac{f \cdot y}{z}$
\]
Where $ f $ is the focal length, and $ z $ is the depth used for visibility tests.

## Common Approaches to Hidden Surface Elimination

There are several algorithms for hidden surface elimination, broadly categorized into **object-space** and **image-space** methods:

1. **Object-Space Methods**:
   - Operate in 3D space before projection.
   - Compare geometric relationships (e.g., polygon overlaps) to determine visibility.
   - Example: **Painter’s Algorithm** (sort polygons by depth and draw from back to front).
   - Pros: Conceptually simple.
   - Cons: Slow for complex scenes, struggles with intersecting polygons.

2. **Image-Space Methods**:
   - Operate in 2D screen space after projection.
   - Compare depths at each pixel to determine the visible surface.
   - Example: **Z-Buffer Algorithm** (store depth values for each pixel and update only if a closer surface is found).
   - Pros: Efficient for complex scenes, handles intersections well.
   - Cons: Requires significant memory for the z-buffer.

3. **Hybrid Methods**:
   - Combine object-space and image-space techniques for efficiency.
   - Example: **Binary Space Partitioning (BSP)** trees to pre-sort geometry, followed by image-space rendering.

### Key Algorithms
- **Z-Buffer Algorithm**:
  - Maintains a depth buffer (z-buffer) for each pixel, initialized to a maximum depth (e.g., $ \infty $).
  - For each polygon, rasterize it and compare its depth $ z $ at each pixel to the stored z-buffer value. Update the pixel color and z-buffer if $ z $ is smaller (closer).
  - Math: For pixel ($ x_s, y_s $), if $ z_{\text{new}} < z_{\text{buffer}}(x_s, y_s) $, update $ z_{\text{buffer}}(x_s, y_s) = z_{\text{new}} $ and set pixel color.

- **Painter’s Algorithm**:
  - Sort polygons by their average or maximum z-depth ($ z_{\text{max}} $).
  - Draw from farthest to nearest, overwriting earlier pixels.
  - Math: Compare $ z_{\text{avg}} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n z_i $ for each polygon’s vertices.

- **Back-Face Culling**:
  - A pre-processing step to eliminate polygons facing away from the viewer.
  - Math: If $ \vec{N} \cdot \vec{V} < 0 $ (where $ \vec{N} $ is the polygon normal and $ \vec{V} $ is the view direction), the polygon is back-facing and culled.

## Practical Considerations
- **Performance**: Image-space methods like z-buffering are preferred in modern GPUs due to their efficiency and compatibility with parallel processing.
- **Memory**: Z-buffering requires a depth buffer, which can be memory-intensive at high resolutions.
- **Transparency**: Special handling is needed for translucent surfaces, often using depth sorting or multiple rendering passes.
- **Applications**: HSE is critical in video games, CAD software, virtual reality, and film rendering to ensure realistic visuals.

## Conclusion
Hidden surface elimination is essential for rendering accurate 3D scenes by ensuring only visible surfaces are drawn. By leveraging depth comparisons and geometric relationships, algorithms like the z-buffer and painter’s algorithm address the challenge of occlusion. These methods balance computational efficiency and visual quality, forming a cornerstone of 3D graphics pipelines. Understanding HSE provides the foundation for advanced rendering techniques, such as shadow mapping and global illumination.
