# Zettelkasten-Based Logging System: Project Requirements and Iterations


## Project Overview
This document outlines the development of a Zettelkasten-based logging system. The project is broken down into four distinct phases, each with manageable iterations, to ensure a structured and progressive development cycle. The system will leverage Firebase for backend services, including data storage, authentication, and file management.

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (The Minimum Viable Product)


This initial phase focuses on establishing the fundamental features of the application. The goal is to create a functional, standalone note-taking tool that serves as the foundation for all future enhancements.


*   **Iteration 1: The Daily Log Foundation & Firebase Setup**
    *   **Goal**: Enable the creation and storage of basic daily log entries using a cloud-based database.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Firebase Project Setup**: Initialize a new Firebase project and integrate the Firebase SDK into the application.
        *   **Manual Log Creation**: Users can create a new note for the current date.
        *   **Basic Text Editor**: A simple editor for writing and saving plain text.
        *   **Firestore for Storage**: Each log is saved as a document in Firestore, with the document ID being the date (e.g., `2025-09-03`).
        *   **Log Viewer**: A basic list interface to view and open saved logs fetched from Firestore.


*   **Iteration 2: Structured Notes with Markdown**
    *   **Goal**: Enhance the logs with structure and rich-text formatting.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Markdown Editor**: Implement a full Markdown editor with a live preview mode.
        *   **Default Daily Template**: Automatically populate new daily logs with predefined headers like **Tasks**, **Learnings**, and **Reflections**.
        *   **Full-Text Search**: Introduce a search function that scans the content of all log documents in Firestore.


*   **Iteration 3: Basic Tagging and Linking**
    *   **Goal**: Introduce foundational organizational and navigational tools.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Simple Tagging**: Allow users to add tags (e.g., `#work`, `#personal`) within the editor, which are stored in the Firestore document.
        *   **Tag-Based Filtering**: Users can filter the log list to display only notes containing a specific tag by querying Firestore.
        *   **Manual Linking**: Implement a linking syntax (e.g., `[[YYYY-MM-DD]]`) that makes it easy to create clickable links between daily logs.
        *   **Day Navigation**: Add "Previous Day" and "Next Day" buttons for simple chronological navigation.

### Phase 2: Zettelkasten Integration and Enhancement


This phase implements the Zettelkasten methodology and introduces automation to create a more intelligent system.


*   **Iteration 4: The Zettelkasten Linking Engine**
    *   **Goal**: Fully integrate the core principles of Zettelkasten.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Atomic Logging**: Assign a unique, timestamp-based ID to each individual entry or paragraph.
        *   **Automatic Backlinking**: When one log links to another, a corresponding backlink is automatically generated in the referenced log using Cloud Functions for Firebase.
        *   **Link Suggestions**: The system intelligently suggests links to related logs based on content or tags as the user types, powered by a Genkit flow.


*   **Iteration 5: Hierarchical Logs and Custom Templates**
    *   **Goal**: Automate weekly and monthly summaries and provide customization options.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Automated Weekly & Monthly Logs**: Use scheduled Cloud Functions to generate summary logs by aggregating entries from daily logs.
        *   **Template Editor**: Allow users to create, save, and manage multiple templates stored in Firestore.
        *   **Hierarchical Tagging**: Introduce support for nested tags (e.g., `#work/project-alpha/meetings`).
        *   **Interactive Checklists**: Add support for interactive to-do lists within the editor.


*   **Iteration 6: Analytics and First Integration**
    *   **Goal**: Introduce data analysis and connect to external tools.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Basic Analytics Dashboard**: Use Firebase Analytics to track user engagement and display metrics like tasks completed and goal completion rates.
        *   **Azure DevOps CSV Import**: Allow users to import work items from a CSV export, automatically creating corresponding log entries in Firestore.
        *   **Advanced Filtering**: Enhance search with multi-criteria filtering by date range, multiple tags, and content type.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features and User Experience


This phase refines the application by adding advanced functionality, motivational elements, and a more polished user experience.


*   **Iteration 7: Rich Content and Professional Exporting**
    *   **Goal**: Support a wider range of media and provide high-quality export options.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Rich Media Integration**: Allow inline embedding of images, PDFs, and other documents using Firebase Storage.
        *   **Advanced Editor Features**: Add support for LaTeX mathematical formulas and Mermaid diagrams.
        *   **LaTeX-Quality PDF Generation**: Create beautifully formatted PDF exports of logs.
        *   **Multiple Export Formats**: Enable data export in JSON, CSV, and HTML formats.


*   **Iteration 8: Gamification and Motivation**
    *   **Goal**: Encourage consistent use and goal achievement.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Points & Streaks System**: Reward users for daily logging streaks and task completion, with data stored in Firestore.
        *   **Progress Visualization**: Implement visual progress bars for goals and habit streak counters.
        *   **Achievement Badges**: Award unlockable badges for reaching milestones.


*   **Iteration 9: Knowledge Integration and AI**
    *   **Goal**: Connect the logging system to learning workflows and introduce intelligent features.
    *   **Features**:
        *   **Flashcard System Integration**: Allow users to export entries tagged `#concept` or `#question` for spaced repetition systems like Anki.
        *   **AI-Powered Insights**: Use Genkit flows to provide smart suggestions for tags, links, and trend analysis on productivity patterns.
        *   **Network Graph Visualization**: Implement a dynamic graph that visually represents the network of interconnected logs and ideas.
