### 1. Objective

Operationalize Dak Madad via a focused pilot at a local sorting-and-delivery hub in Indore, validate core workflows and technology, then refine and scale across the network.

---

### 2. Pilot Launch: Local Sorting & Delivery Hub (Indore)

- Select the Indore facility‚Äôs sorting and last-mile delivery unit for end-to-end testing.
    
- Allows controlled validation of bulk data handling, QR-based tracking, address correction, and feedback loops.
    

---

### 3. Phase-Wise Implementation Plan

**Phase 1 ‚Äì Pilot Rollout (June‚ÄìJuly 2025)**

- Install mobile app for staff and integrate Dak Madad into existing sorting/dispatch workflow
    
- Batch-process address data for geolocation and QR code generation on registered-post receipts
    
- Train delivery personnel on QR scanning, route assistance, and feedback capture
    
- Monitor real-time performance metrics and error logs
    

**Phase 2 ‚Äì Evaluation & Optimization (August 2025)**

- Measure impacts: delivery accuracy gains, sorting speed improvements, user feedback
    
- Identify technical or operational adjustments (throughput tuning, UI refinements)
    
- Update standard operating procedures for broader rollout
    

**Phase 3 ‚Äì Scaling & Integration (September‚ÄìDecember 2025)**

- Extend deployment to additional regional hubs in tier-2 cities (e.g., Bhopal, Vadodara, Jaipur)
    
- Formalize API integrations and secure partnerships (MapMyIndia licensing, internal address database)
    
- Begin compiling national address-correction repository (DigiPIN)
    

---

### 4. Key Technical Actions

- Develop a backend batch-geocoding and PIN-validation module
    
- Integrate MapMyIndia API as primary geolocation service (fallback: Google Maps)
    
- Implement multilingual UI support for Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, etc.
    
- Enforce end-to-end encryption, fine-grained access controls, and audit trails
    

---

### 5. Documentation & Communications (Pre-Third Meeting Deliverables)

- **Technical Architecture Document:** Data flows, modules, integration points, security
    
- **Gap Analysis Report:** Issues observed at the Indore sorting/delivery unit and how Dak Madad fills each gap
    
- **Meeting Summaries:** Key outcomes from April 11 and April 30 sessions
    
- **SIH Experience Deck:** Evolution of Dak Madad from concept to working prototype
    
- **MapMyIndia Collaboration Plan:** API capabilities, licensing terms, data-accuracy benchmarks
    

---

### 6. Immediate Next Steps

- Finalize and print all technical deliverables
    
- Engage MapMyIndia to confirm API access, pricing, and SLA
    
- Rehearse stakeholder presentation (target: first week of June)
    
- Coordinate pilot logistics and staff training schedule
    

---

### 7. Expected Impact at Pilot Site

- **10‚Äì15%** uplift in sorting and delivery efficiency
    
- Significant reduction in misrouted items via AI-driven address correction
    
- Real-time visibility and accountability through QR-enabled scans and user feedback
    
- Establishment of foundational DigiPIN data for nationwide roll-out
