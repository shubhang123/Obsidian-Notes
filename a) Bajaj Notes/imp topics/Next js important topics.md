#nextjs 
In a Next.js PWA application, you might see special files like _document.js and _app.js (or their TypeScript equivalents, _document.tsx and _app.tsx). These files play crucial roles in customizing and enhancing your Next.js app. The underscore (_) prefix is a Next.js convention that indicates these files are special components used to override or extend the default behavior of the framework.



**What is _app.js?**

_app.js (or _app.tsx in TypeScript) is a custom App component in Next.js that acts as a wrapper for all pages. It allows you to:

* Persist layout between pages
* Maintain global state (e.g., Redux, Context API)
* Apply global styles
* Register service workers for PWA functionality
* Ensures global service worker registration
* Provides state management for offline features
* Allows global styles and layouts to persist\

**What is _document.js?**

_document.js (or _document.tsx) is a custom Document component in Next.js that modifies the HTML structure of the application. It runs only on the server side and is useful for adding:

* Custom fonts
* PWA metadata (e.g., manifest.json, theme-color)
* Global scripts
