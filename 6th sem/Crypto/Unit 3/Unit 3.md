I’ll provide concise, structured notes for each topic in Unit III of your Cryptography and Network Security syllabus. The notes will be clear, focused, and suitable for quick understanding and revision. I’ll cover each topic one by one, starting with **Hash Functions**. Let’s begin!

### 1. Hash Functions

#### Definition
A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (or message) of arbitrary length and produces a fixed-length output called a **hash value**, **digest**, or **checksum**.

#### Key Properties
- **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same output.
- **Fixed Output Size**: Regardless of input size, the output is always a fixed length (e.g., 256 bits for SHA-256).
- **Pre-image Resistance**: Given a hash value, it’s computationally infeasible to find the original input.
- **Collision Resistance**: It’s computationally infeasible to find two different inputs that produce the same hash value.
- **Second Pre-image Resistance**: Given an input and its hash, it’s hard to find another input with the same hash.
- **Fast Computation**: Hash functions are designed to be computationally efficient.

#### Applications
- **Data Integrity**: Verify that data has not been altered (e.g., file checksums).
- **Password Storage**: Store hashed passwords instead of plaintext.
- **Digital Signatures**: Used to sign messages or verify authenticity.
- **Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies**: Secure transactions and link blocks.

#### Common Hash Functions
- MD5 (128-bit, now considered weak due to collision vulnerabilities).
- SHA-1 (160-bit, deprecated for security-critical applications).
- SHA-2 (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512, more secure).
- SHA-3 (based on Keccak, resistant to quantum attacks).

#### Limitations
- Vulnerable to brute-force attacks if poorly designed.
- Collision attacks (e.g., MD5 and SHA-1 are no longer secure for critical applications).

### 2. One-way Hash Functions

#### Definition
A one-way hash function is a type of hash function designed to be computationally infeasible to reverse, meaning you cannot easily derive the original input from the hash output. It maps data of arbitrary size to a fixed-size hash value.

#### Key Characteristics
- **One-way Property**: Easy to compute the hash from the input, but computationally infeasible to find the input given the hash (pre-image resistance).
- **Collision Resistance**: Hard to find two different inputs producing the same hash.
- **Second Pre-image Resistance**: Given an input and its hash, it’s infeasible to find another input with the same hash.
- **Fixed Output Length**: Produces a consistent length output (e.g., 256 bits for SHA-256).
- **Avalanche Effect**: A small change in the input (e.g., one bit) results in a significantly different hash output.

#### How It Works
- Takes input data (e.g., a file or message).
- Processes it through a series of mathematical operations (e.g., bitwise operations, modular arithmetic).
- Outputs a fixed-length hash value (digest).

#### Examples
- **SHA-256**: Part of the SHA-2 family, widely used in secure applications.
- **SHA-3**: Based on the Keccak algorithm, designed for enhanced security.
- **MD5**: Older, now insecure due to collision vulnerabilities.
- **RIPEMD-160**: Less common but used in some cryptographic applications.

#### Applications
- **Password Hashing**: Store hashed passwords to prevent plaintext exposure.
- **Digital Signatures**: Ensure message integrity and authenticity.
- **File Integrity Checks**: Verify that files haven’t been tampered with.
- **Cryptographic Protocols**: Used in SSL/TLS, blockchain, and more.

#### Security Considerations
- Must resist brute-force, pre-image, and collision attacks.
- Older algorithms like MD5 and SHA-1 are vulnerable and should be avoided for security-critical applications.
- Modern one-way hash functions (e.g., SHA-3) are designed to resist quantum computing attacks.

#### Limitations
- If the hash function is weak (e.g., MD5), attackers can find collisions or reverse-engineer inputs.
- Hash length must be sufficiently large to prevent brute-force attacks.
