### Cryptography
**Definition**: Cryptography is the science of securing communication and data by transforming information into an unreadable format (encryption) to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation, and then converting it back to readable form (decryption) for authorized parties.

**Key Objectives**:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures only authorized users can access the data.
- **Integrity**: Guarantees data remains unaltered during transmission or storage.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the sender or receiver.
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevents the sender from denying they sent the message.

**Types**:
- **Symmetric Cryptography**: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES). Fast but requires secure key exchange.
- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Uses a public-private key pair (e.g., RSA, ECC). Slower but simplifies key distribution.
- **Hash Functions**: One-way functions for data integrity (e.g., SHA-256).

**Applications**:
- Secure communication (e.g., SSL/TLS for HTTPS).
- Data protection (e.g., encrypted storage).
- Digital signatures and blockchain.

**Example**: Encrypting a message with AES to send it securely over the internet.
