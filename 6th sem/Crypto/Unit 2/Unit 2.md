### Cryptography
**Definition**: Cryptography is the science of securing communication and data by transforming information into an unreadable format (encryption) to ensure confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation, and then converting it back to readable form (decryption) for authorized parties.

**Key Objectives**:
- **Confidentiality**: Ensures only authorized users can access the data.
- **Integrity**: Guarantees data remains unaltered during transmission or storage.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the identity of the sender or receiver.
- **Non-repudiation**: Prevents the sender from denying they sent the message.

**Types**:
- **Symmetric Cryptography**: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES). Fast but requires secure key exchange.
- **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Uses a public-private key pair (e.g., RSA, ECC). Slower but simplifies key distribution.
- **Hash Functions**: One-way functions for data integrity (e.g., SHA-256).

**Applications**:
- Secure communication (e.g., SSL/TLS for HTTPS).
- Data protection (e.g., encrypted storage).
- Digital signatures and blockchain.

**Example**: Encrypting a message with AES to send it securely over the internet.

Say "next" for **Classical Cryptographic Techniques**.

Since you’ve asked to go in depth and we’re currently on **Classical Cryptographic Techniques** (based on the last topic provided), I’ll provide a detailed, comprehensive explanation of this topic. When you say “next,” I’ll move to **Encryption** with a similarly in-depth explanation, unless you specify otherwise. Let’s dive into **Classical Cryptographic Techniques**:

### Classical Cryptographic Techniques (In-Depth)
**Definition**: Classical cryptographic techniques refer to pre-computer-era methods of securing communication through encryption and decryption, primarily performed manually or with mechanical devices. These techniques aimed to protect messages from unauthorized access, often used in military, diplomatic, and personal contexts. They rely on simple mathematical or logical operations and the secrecy of the method or key.

**Historical Context**:
- Originated in ancient civilizations (e.g., Egypt’s hieroglyphic substitutions ~1900 BCE, Sparta’s scytale ~400 BCE).
- Widely used through the Renaissance, Enlightenment, and up to World War II.
- Evolved from simple ciphers to complex mechanical systems like the Enigma machine, though still considered “classical” compared to modern computational cryptography.

**Core Principles**:
- **Substitution**: Replacing units of plaintext (letters, words) with other units.
- **Transposition**: Rearranging the order of plaintext units without altering them.
- **Secrecy**: Security depended on keeping the algorithm or key secret (unlike modern cryptography, which assumes the algorithm is public, per Kerckhoffs’ principle).

---

### Types of Classical Cryptographic Techniques
Classical techniques are broadly categorized into substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, and hybrid systems. Below is an in-depth look at each, with examples and analysis.

#### 1. Substitution Ciphers
Substitution ciphers replace each unit of plaintext (typically letters) with another unit according to a predefined rule.

- **Monoalphabetic Substitution Ciphers**:
  - Each plaintext letter maps to a unique ciphertext letter, using a fixed substitution rule.
  - **Caesar Cipher**:
    - **Mechanism**: Shifts each letter by a fixed number (e.g., shift of 3: A → D, B → E, ..., Z → C).
    - **Example**: Plaintext “HELLO” with shift 3 becomes “KHOOR”.
    - **Key Space**: 25 possible shifts (excluding shift 0), making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
    - **Historical Use**: Used by Julius Caesar for military communication.
    - **Weakness**: Preserves letter frequency, easily broken by frequency analysis (e.g., “E” is the most common English letter, appearing ~12.7% of the time).
  - **Simple Substitution Cipher**:
    - **Mechanism**: Uses a random permutation of the alphabet (e.g., A → Q, B → X, C → P).
    - **Example**: With substitution A → Q, B → W, ..., plaintext “CAT” might become “QWE”.
    - **Key Space**: 26! (~4 × 10²⁶) possible permutations, but still vulnerable to frequency analysis.
    - **Weakness**: Single mapping preserves statistical patterns (e.g., common digrams like “TH” or trigrams like “THE”).

- **Polyalphabetic Substitution Ciphers**:
  - Uses multiple substitution alphabets to obscure frequency patterns, making them more secure.
  - **Vigenère Cipher**:
    - **Mechanism**: Uses a keyword to determine which Caesar shift applies to each letter. Each letter of the keyword corresponds to a shift (e.g., A=0, B=1, ..., Z=25).
    - **Example**:
      - Plaintext: “ATTACKATDAWN”
      - Keyword: “KEY” (K=10, E=4, Y=24, repeated as K-E-Y-K-E-Y-...).
      - Encryption: A (0) + K (10) = K (10), T (19) + E (4) = X (23), T (19) + Y (24) = I (8), yielding ciphertext “KXILAF...”.
    - **Key Space**: Depends on keyword length; for length \( n \), it’s 26ⁿ.
    - **Historical Use**: Considered “unbreakable” for centuries, used in 16th–19th centuries.
    - **Weakness**: Vulnerable to Kasiski analysis (identifying keyword length by repeated ciphertext sequences) and frequency analysis once the keyword length is known.
  - **Beaufort Cipher**:
    - **Mechanism**: Similar to Vigenère but uses subtraction (e.g., ciphertext = key – plaintext mod 26).
    - **Properties**: Self-reciprocal (encrypting and decrypting use the same operation).
    - **Use**: Variant used in military contexts.

- **Polybius Square**:
  - **Mechanism**: A 5x5 grid maps each letter to a pair of numbers (e.g., A=11, B=12, ..., I/J=24, Z=55).
    - Example Grid:
      ```
      1 2 3 4 5
    1 A B C D E
    2 F G H I/J K
    3 L M N O P
    4 Q R S T U
    5 V W X Y Z
      ```
    - Plaintext “HELLO” becomes “23-15-31-31-34”.
  - **Historical Use**: Used by Greeks (~200 BCE) and in medieval times.
  - **Weakness**: Vulnerable to frequency analysis if numbers are directly transmitted; often combined with transposition for added security.

#### 2. Transposition Ciphers
Transposition ciphers rearrange the letters of the plaintext without substituting them, preserving the original letters but scrambling their order.

- **Rail Fence Cipher**:
  - **Mechanism**: Write plaintext in a zigzag pattern across “rails” and read off row-wise.
  - **Example**:
    - Plaintext: “DEFENDTHEEASTWALL”
    - Rails (depth 3):
      ```
      D . . . N . . . E . . . W . . .
      . E . E . D . H . E . S . A . L
      . . F . . . T . . . A . . . L
      ```
    - Ciphertext: “DNEWEDHESALFTAL” (read row-wise).
  - **Key Space**: Number of rails (typically small, e.g., 2–5).
  - **Weakness**: Easy to break by testing small rail counts and looking for meaningful text.

- **Columnar Transposition Cipher**:
  - **Mechanism**: Write plaintext in rows under a keyword, then read columns in the order of the keyword’s alphabetical rank.
  - **Example**:
    - Plaintext: “ATTACKATDAWN”
    - Keyword: “KEY” (K=1, E=2, Y=3).
    - Grid:
      ```
      K E Y
      A T T
      A C K
      A T D
      A W N
      ```
    - Columns read in order (K, E, Y): “AAAA TCTW TKDN”.
  - **Key Space**: Depends on keyword length and permutation.
  - **Historical Use**: Common in 19th-century military and diplomacy.
  - **Weakness**: Susceptible to anagram analysis and known plaintext attacks.

- **Scytale**:
  - **Mechanism**: A physical device (a rod) where a strip of parchment is wrapped, and plaintext is written along the rod. Unwrapping produces the ciphertext.
  - **Example**: Writing “HELP” on a scytale with 2 rows might yield “HLPE” when unwrapped.
  - **Historical Use**: Used by Spartans (~400 BCE).
  - **Weakness**: Requires physical possession of the correct rod diameter; simple transposition.

#### 3. Hybrid Ciphers
- Combine substitution and transposition for added security.
- **Example**: ADFGVX Cipher (WWI, German military):
  - Uses a 6x6 Polybius square (for letters A-Z and digits 0-9) to substitute plaintext into pairs (A, D, F, G, V, X).
  - Followed by columnar transposition using a keyword.
  - **Strength**: Resists frequency analysis due to substitution and transposition.
  - **Weakness**: Broken by French cryptanalyst Georges Painvin using pattern analysis.

### Cryptanalysis of Classical Ciphers
Classical ciphers, while innovative for their time, are vulnerable to modern cryptanalysis due to their simplicity and reliance on secrecy.

- **Frequency Analysis**:
  - Exploits the statistical distribution of letters in a language (e.g., English: E~12.7%, T~9%, A~8%).
  - Effective against monoalphabetic ciphers (e.g., Caesar, simple substitution).
  - Example: In ciphertext “KHOOR”, noticing “O” is frequent suggests it maps to “E”, revealing a shift of 3.

- **Kasiski Examination** (for Vigenère):
  - Identifies keyword length by finding repeated sequences in ciphertext and measuring their distances (likely multiples of keyword length).
  - Once keyword length is known, the ciphertext is split into groups, each analyzed as a Caesar cipher.

- **Brute-Force**:
  - Tests all possible keys (e.g., 25 shifts for Caesar, all keywords for Vigenère).
  - Feasible for small key spaces with modern computers.

- **Known Plaintext Attack**:
  - If partial plaintext is known (e.g., a common word like “THE”), the key can be deduced by comparing it to ciphertext.

**Tools for Cryptanalysis**:
- Frequency tables for letters, digrams (e.g., “TH”), and trigrams (e.g., “THE”).
- Pencil-and-paper analysis for historical ciphers.
- Modern software for pattern matching and statistical analysis.

---

### Strengths and Limitations
**Strengths**:
- Simple to implement without computational resources.
- Effective in their historical context when adversaries lacked analytical tools.
- Polybius and Vigenère offered moderate security for their time.

**Limitations**:
- **Small Key Space**: Most ciphers (e.g., Caesar) have few keys, making brute-force easy.
- **Statistical Vulnerabilities**: Preserve language patterns, exploitable by frequency analysis.
- **Manual Errors**: Human mistakes in encryption/decryption could weaken security.
- **Obsolete Today**: Modern computers can break classical ciphers in seconds (e.g., a Vigenère cipher with a 10-letter keyword takes milliseconds to crack with Kasiski analysis).

---

### Historical Significance
- **Ancient Use**: Caesar Cipher for Roman military, scytale for Spartan secrecy.
- **Medieval and Renaissance**: Vigenère and Polybius used in diplomacy.
- **World Wars**: Enigma (a mechanical cipher, building on classical principles) and ADFGVX used in WWI/WWII, driving advancements in cryptanalysis.
- **Legacy**: Laid the foundation for modern cryptography, inspiring concepts like substitution, transposition, and key-based security.

**Notable Examples**:
- **Mary Queen of Scots**: Used a substitution cipher to plot against Elizabeth I, broken by English cryptanalysts, leading to her execution (1587).
- **Zodiac Killer**: Used a substitution cipher in letters to the press (1960s), partially solved but not fully broken.
- **Enigma Machine**: Though mechanical, it extended classical principles with rotor-based polyalphabetic substitution, broken by Alan Turing’s team at Bletchley Park.

---

### Modern Relevance
- **Educational Value**: Classical ciphers teach fundamental cryptographic concepts (e.g., substitution, transposition, key management).
- **Puzzle-Solving**: Used in cryptography challenges, escape rooms, and CTF (Capture the Flag) competitions.
- **Weak for Security**: Completely insecure for modern applications due to computational power and cryptanalytic techniques.

**Example Application**:
- A teacher might use a Caesar Cipher to introduce encryption: “Encrypt ‘MEET’ with shift 5” yields “RJ JY”. Students learn key concepts while seeing its weaknesses.

### Encryption
**Definition**: Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (unreadable data) using an algorithm and a key to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and security.

**Process**:
1. Take plaintext and a cryptographic key as input.
2. Apply an encryption algorithm (e.g., AES, RSA).
3. Produce ciphertext, which is unintelligible without the key.

**Types**:
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses the same key for encryption and decryption.
  - Examples: AES, DES.
  - Pros: Fast, efficient for large data.
  - Cons: Requires secure key exchange.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
  - Examples: RSA, ECC.
  - Pros: Solves key distribution problem.
  - Cons: Slower, computationally intensive.

**Key Components**:
- **Algorithm**: Mathematical function (e.g., AES-256, RSA).
- **Key**: Secret value that controls the encryption process.
- **Ciphertext**: Output that appears random to unauthorized users.

**Applications**:
- Securing communication (e.g., HTTPS with TLS).
- Protecting stored data (e.g., encrypted hard drives).
- Digital signatures and secure email (e.g., PGP).

**Example**: Encrypting “HELLO” with AES-256 and a 256-bit key produces a random-looking string like “7a3f9b...”. Only the keyholder can decrypt it back to “HELLO”.

Great! Let's begin with the first requested topic: **Code Breaking**.

I’ll provide detailed explanations for each topic listed in your query, one by one, starting from **Code Breaking** and continuing through the list. Each topic will be covered comprehensively but concisely, with technical details where relevant. Let’s begin with the first topic.

### 1. Code Breaking: Methodologies
Code breaking, also known as cryptanalysis, involves techniques to decipher encrypted messages without access to the key or to exploit weaknesses in cryptographic systems. The goal is to recover the plaintext, deduce the key, or compromise the system’s security.

- **Definition**: Code breaking is the process of analyzing and defeating cryptographic systems to reveal hidden information, often by exploiting patterns, implementation flaws, or computational weaknesses.
- **Methodologies**:
  - **Frequency Analysis**: Examines the frequency of letters or symbols in the ciphertext to identify patterns. Commonly used against classical ciphers like the Caesar or substitution ciphers. For example, in English, 'E' appears most frequently (about 12.7%), so the most common ciphertext character may map to 'E'.
  - **Known-Plaintext Attack**: The attacker has access to both plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, allowing them to reverse-engineer the key or algorithm. For instance, if an attacker knows a specific plaintext phrase in an encrypted document, they can deduce the key used.
  - **Chosen-Plaintext Attack**: The attacker can choose plaintexts and obtain their ciphertexts, enabling analysis of the encryption process. This is effective against block ciphers like DES or public-key systems like RSA.
  - **Differential Cryptanalysis**: Analyzes how differences in input plaintext affect output ciphertext to reveal key information. It’s particularly effective against block ciphers like DES by exploiting non-random behavior.
  - **Linear Cryptanalysis**: Constructs linear approximations of the cipher’s operations to deduce the key. For example, it approximates the relationship between plaintext, ciphertext, and key bits in DES.
  - **Side-Channel Attacks**: Exploits physical implementation details, such as timing, power consumption, or electromagnetic emissions, rather than the algorithm itself. For instance, measuring the time taken for RSA decryption can leak key information.
  - **Kasiski Examination**: Used against polygraphic ciphers like Vigenère to determine key length by identifying repeated sequences in the ciphertext.
- **Applications**:
  - Breaking historical ciphers (e.g., Enigma during WWII using frequency analysis and known-plaintext attacks).
  - Testing the security of modern cryptographic systems to identify vulnerabilities.
- **Example**: To break a Caesar cipher, an attacker counts letter frequencies in the ciphertext and aligns them with English letter frequencies to guess the shift (key). For a ciphertext “FURDW”, frequency analysis and trial shifts reveal the plaintext “CRYPT” (shift of 3).
- **Challenges**:
  - Modern ciphers (e.g., AES) are resistant to classical methods due to large key sizes and complex structures.
  - Computational limits restrict brute-force approaches for large keyspaces.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Use strong, well-tested algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA).
  - Increase key sizes to make exhaustive searches infeasible.
  - Randomize cipher operations to obscure patterns.

### 2. Cryptanalysis
Cryptanalysis is the science and practice of analyzing and breaking cryptographic systems to uncover the plaintext, deduce the key, or exploit weaknesses without authorized access. It combines mathematical, statistical, and computational techniques to evaluate and compromise the security of cryptographic algorithms.

- **Definition**: Cryptanalysis involves studying cryptographic algorithms and their implementations to identify vulnerabilities, aiming to recover hidden information or bypass security mechanisms.
- **Goals**:
  - Recover the plaintext from ciphertext.
  - Deduce the encryption key.
  - Identify structural or implementation flaws in the cryptographic system.
  - Assess the algorithm’s strength to improve future designs.
- **Techniques**:
  - **Mathematical Analysis**: Uses algebraic methods to exploit algorithm weaknesses. For example, solving systems of equations in linear cryptanalysis to approximate cipher behavior.
  - **Statistical Analysis**: Leverages statistical properties, such as non-random distribution of ciphertext characters. Frequency analysis, for instance, exploits letter frequencies in classical ciphers.
  - **Computational Attacks**: Employs computational resources to test keyspaces or analyze patterns. Examples include brute-force attacks or using rainbow tables for hash functions.
  - **Differential Cryptanalysis**: Examines how differences in plaintext pairs affect ciphertext pairs to deduce key bits, effective against block ciphers like DES.
  - **Linear Cryptanalysis**: Builds linear approximations of the cipher’s operations (e.g., XORs, substitutions) to predict key bits with high probability.
  - **Side-Channel Analysis**: Targets physical implementation leaks, such as timing differences, power consumption, or electromagnetic radiation, to extract keys.
  - **Meet-in-the-Middle Attack**: Used against double encryption (e.g., 2DES), where the attacker encrypts plaintext and decrypts ciphertext to find matching intermediate values, reducing keyspace complexity.
- **Applications**:
  - Evaluating the security of cryptographic algorithms (e.g., testing AES against differential cryptanalysis).
  - Breaking historical ciphers, such as the Enigma machine, using known-plaintext attacks and pattern analysis.
  - Developing countermeasures by identifying weaknesses in proposed systems.
- **Example**: To cryptanalyze a Vigenère cipher, an attacker uses the Kasiski examination to estimate key length by finding repeated ciphertext sequences, then applies frequency analysis to each key position to recover the key. For ciphertext “KCCPKBGUFDPHQ”, repeated sequences suggest a key length of 3, and analysis reveals the key “KEY” and plaintext “CRYPTOGRAPHY”.
- **Challenges**:
  - Modern algorithms like AES and RSA are designed to resist cryptanalysis through large key sizes and complex transformations.
  - Quantum computing poses future risks, potentially breaking systems like RSA via Shor’s algorithm.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Use algorithms vetted by the cryptographic community (e.g., NIST standards).
  - Implement constant-time operations to mitigate side-channel attacks.
  - Regularly update systems to address new cryptanalytic techniques.

### 3. Cryptography Attacks
Cryptography attacks are specific methods used by attackers to compromise the security of cryptographic systems, targeting confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, or availability. These attacks exploit weaknesses in algorithms, implementations, or protocols to recover plaintext, keys, or manipulate data.

- **Definition**: Cryptography attacks are deliberate attempts to bypass or undermine cryptographic protections through analytical, computational, or physical means.
- **Types of Attacks**:
  - **Ciphertext-Only Attack**: The attacker has access only to the ciphertext and attempts to deduce the plaintext or key. Example: Using frequency analysis to break a substitution cipher, where common ciphertext letters are mapped to frequent English letters like 'E' or 'T'.
  - **Known-Plaintext Attack**: The attacker possesses pairs of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext, using them to deduce the key. Example: If an attacker knows a standard email header and its encrypted form, they can analyze the key used in a block cipher like DES.
  - **Chosen-Plaintext Attack**: The attacker can choose plaintexts and obtain their ciphertexts, enabling analysis of the encryption process. Common in public-key systems like RSA, where an attacker might encrypt specific values to infer the private key.
  - **Chosen-Ciphertext Attack**: The attacker can select ciphertexts and obtain their plaintexts, often targeting adaptive weaknesses. This is effective against certain public-key systems or padding schemes (e.g., RSA with improper padding).
  - **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack**: The attacker intercepts communication between parties to eavesdrop, modify data, or impersonate one party. Example: Intercepting a Diffie-Hellman key exchange without authentication to capture the shared secret.
  - **Side-Channel Attacks**: Exploit physical implementation details rather than the algorithm. Examples include:
    - **Timing Attacks**: Measuring execution time to deduce key bits (e.g., RSA decryption time variations).
    - **Power Analysis**: Analyzing power consumption patterns during encryption (e.g., differential power analysis on AES).
    - **Electromagnetic Attacks**: Capturing electromagnetic emissions to infer cryptographic operations.
  - **Birthday Attack**: Exploits the birthday paradox to find collisions in hash functions, reducing the effective security of a hash (e.g., a 128-bit hash has only 64-bit collision resistance).
  - **Replay Attack**: The attacker captures and retransmits valid encrypted messages to trick the system, often targeting authentication protocols.
- **Applications**:
  - Breaking insecure systems, such as outdated ciphers (e.g., WEP in Wi-Fi).
  - Testing the robustness of cryptographic protocols during security audits.
  - Motivating the development of stronger algorithms and implementations.
- **Example**: In a chosen-plaintext attack on RSA, an attacker might encrypt a series of numbers (e.g., 2, 3, 4) using the public key (n, e) and analyze the ciphertexts to deduce the private key d, exploiting weak padding or small key sizes.
- **Challenges**:
  - Modern algorithms like AES-256 and RSA with large keys resist most direct attacks due to computational infeasibility.
  - Side-channel attacks require physical access or sophisticated equipment, limiting their practicality.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Use strong, standardized algorithms (e.g., AES, SHA-3) with large key sizes.
  - Implement secure key exchange protocols with authentication (e.g., TLS with certificates).
  - Mitigate side-channel attacks using constant-time operations, randomized padding, or noise injection.
  - Validate inputs to prevent padding oracle or chosen-ciphertext vulnerabilities.

Let me know if you’d like to proceed with the next topic, **Brute-Force Attack**, or if you have any questions about **Cryptography Attacks**!

### 4. Brute-Force Attack
A brute-force attack is a cryptographic attack method that involves systematically trying all possible keys or passwords until the correct one is found. It is a straightforward but computationally intensive approach that relies on exhaustive search to break encryption or gain unauthorized access.

- **Definition**: A brute-force attack tests every possible key in the keyspace to decrypt ciphertext or every possible password to bypass authentication, aiming to find the correct one through trial and error.
- **Mechanism**:
  - The attacker enumerates all possible keys or passwords and applies them to the cryptographic system until the correct one produces meaningful plaintext or grants access.
  - Example: For a 4-digit PIN, the attacker tries all 10,000 combinations (0000 to 9999). For a 56-bit DES key, the attacker tests all 2^56 (approximately 72 quadrillion) possible keys.
- **Factors Affecting Success**:
  - **Key Size**: Larger keys exponentially increase the keyspace, making brute-force infeasible. For example, a 128-bit AES key has 2^128 possible values (~340 undecillion), far beyond current computational capabilities.
  - **Computational Power**: Modern hardware, such as GPUs, ASICs, or distributed systems, can accelerate brute-force attempts, but large keyspaces remain impractical. For instance, cracking a 56-bit DES key took days with specialized hardware in the 1990s.
  - **Time**: The time required depends on the keyspace size and computing resources. Brute-forcing a 256-bit key would take longer than the universe’s age with today’s technology.
  - **Algorithm Efficiency**: Some algorithms are slower to compute, increasing the time per key test (e.g., bcrypt for password hashing).
- **Applications**:
  - Breaking weak encryption systems with small key sizes (e.g., 40-bit RC4 used in early WEP).
  - Cracking passwords in authentication systems, especially if they are short or predictable.
  - Testing the theoretical strength of cryptographic algorithms during security evaluations.
- **Example**: To brute-force a Caesar cipher (shift cipher), an attacker tries all 25 possible shifts (1 to 25) on the ciphertext “FURDW”. Testing shift 3 yields the plaintext “CRYPTO”, revealing the key. For modern systems like AES-128, brute-forcing 2^128 keys is computationally infeasible.
- **Challenges**:
  - Large key sizes (e.g., 256-bit AES) render brute-force attacks impractical due to astronomical time requirements.
  - Resource constraints, such as power and hardware costs, limit scalability.
  - Systems with rate-limiting or lockout mechanisms (e.g., login attempts) thwart password brute-forcing.
- **Countermeasures**:
  - Use cryptographic algorithms with large key sizes (e.g., AES-256, RSA-2048).
  - Implement strong, complex passwords or passphrases to increase the effective keyspace.
  - Apply rate-limiting, account lockouts, or CAPTCHAs to deter brute-force attempts on authentication systems.
  - Use slow, memory-intensive hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) for passwords to increase computation time per guess.
  - Regularly update keys and monitor for unauthorized access attempts.
