## üõ†Ô∏è Trojans and Backdoors

### Trojans

A **Trojan Horse**, or simply **Trojan**, is a type of malicious software that disguises itself as a legitimate application or file to trick users into installing it. Once executed, it can perform unauthorized actions without the user's consent or knowledge.

Trojans do not replicate themselves like viruses or worms. Instead, they rely on users to spread them‚Äîoften through social engineering tactics, fake software, or email attachments.

### Backdoors

A **Backdoor** is a hidden method used by attackers to bypass normal authentication or security mechanisms of a system. Once installed‚Äîoften via a Trojan‚Äîit allows remote access to the compromised system, enabling the attacker to control the system or extract data.

### Overt and Covert Channels

- **Overt Channel**: A legitimate and intended channel of communication (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
    
- **Covert Channel**: An unintended or hidden communication path used to transfer information secretly, often to exfiltrate data or issue commands to malware.

### Working of Trojans and Backdoors

1. The attacker sends a Trojan to the target disguised as a legitimate file.
    
2. The user unknowingly installs the Trojan.
    
3. The Trojan installs a backdoor or performs other malicious tasks (e.g., logging keystrokes, stealing credentials).
    
4. The attacker gains unauthorized access via the backdoor and executes commands remotely.

### Types of Trojans

1. **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Provide the attacker with full control over the victim's system.
    
2. **Data-Sending Trojans**: Collect and transmit sensitive data such as passwords, keystrokes, or screenshots.
    
3. **Destructive Trojans**: Intentionally destroy files, formats drives, or corrupt data.
    
4. **Proxy Trojans**: Turn the victim's system into a proxy server, used to hide the attacker‚Äôs identity or carry out further attacks.
    
5. **FTP Trojans**: Open port 21 and set up an unauthorized FTP server on the victim's system.
    
6. **Security Software Disablers**: Disable antivirus, firewall, or other security tools, allowing further infections or attacks.
