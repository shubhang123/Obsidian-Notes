## **Viruses and Worms â€“ Characteristics**

---

### **Introduction**

**Viruses** and **worms** are both types of **self-replicating malware**, but they behave differently. A **virus** attaches itself to a host file or program and requires **user action** to spread, whereas a **worm** is a **standalone program** that spreads **automatically** across networks without any human interaction.

Despite these differences, both aim to **propagate**, **disrupt systems**, and **cause damage or unauthorized access**.

### **Characteristics of Viruses**

- **Host-dependent**: A virus cannot function independently and must attach to an executable file, document macro, or boot sector.
    
- **Activation required**: It needs to be run or opened by a user to start infecting.
    
- **Spreads through file transfers, USBs, email attachments**, etc.
    
- **Can lie dormant** until triggered by certain events (e.g., a specific date).
    
- May **delete files, corrupt programs, slow down system performance**, or display annoying messages.
    
- Some viruses are **polymorphic** (change their code to avoid detection) or **metamorphic** (rewrite themselves entirely).

### **Characteristics of Worms**

- **Independent and self-replicating**: A worm does not need a host file; it can execute and spread by itself.
    
- **Network-aware**: Exploits system vulnerabilities or weak network configurations to spread (e.g., via open ports or email address books).
    
- **Spreads rapidly**, often causing **network congestion** or service downtime.
    
- Can deliver **payloads** like backdoors, ransomware, or other malware.
    
- Often used in the creation of **botnets**â€”a network of infected computers controlled remotely.

## **Viruses and Worms â€“ Working**

---

### **Working of a Virus**

A **computer virus** operates much like a biological virus: it infects a host, replicates, and spreads to new environments. Here's how it works:

1. **Infection**:
    
    - A virus attaches itself to a legitimate file or program (like `.exe`, `.doc`, or `.dll`).
        
    - When the user opens or runs the infected file, the virus code is executed.
        
2. **Replication**:
    
    - The virus scans the system for other files to infect.
        
    - It embeds a copy of itself into these files, often without changing the file size or structure noticeably.
        
3. **Execution of Payload**:
    
    - Some viruses contain harmful payloads that activate after certain conditions are met (e.g., on a specific date or after a number of executions).
        
    - The payload can range from displaying messages to deleting files or formatting the disk.
        
4. **Persistence**:
    
    - Viruses often use stealth techniques to remain undetected, such as hiding in memory or using code obfuscation.
        
    - They may also disable antivirus tools or replicate to backup locations to reinfect the system later.

### **Working of a Worm**

A **worm** differs from a virus in that it is self-contained and designed to propagate itself independently, primarily through network connections.

1. **Execution**:
    
    - Once executed (e.g., through a malicious email attachment or an exploit), the worm activates immediately.
        
2. **Scanning and Propagation**:
    
    - The worm scans the local network or internet for vulnerable systems (e.g., systems with open ports or weak security).
        
    - Once a vulnerable system is found, the worm copies itself over and executes remotely.
        
3. **Replication**:
    
    - On each new system, the worm repeats the processâ€”scanning, exploiting, and infecting.
        
    - It may create copies of itself in multiple locations to ensure continued survival.
        
4. **Optional Payload**:
    
    - Some worms do nothing more than replicate, but many carry additional payloads such as ransomware, spyware, or backdoors.
        
5. **Impact**:
    
    - Even if no malicious payload is delivered, the sheer volume of replication can lead to **network slowdowns**, **service crashes**, and **system instability**.
