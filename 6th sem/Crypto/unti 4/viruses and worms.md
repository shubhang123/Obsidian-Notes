## **Viruses and Worms â€“ Characteristics**

---

### **Introduction**

**Viruses** and **worms** are both types of **self-replicating malware**, but they behave differently. A **virus** attaches itself to a host file or program and requires **user action** to spread, whereas a **worm** is a **standalone program** that spreads **automatically** across networks without any human interaction.

Despite these differences, both aim to **propagate**, **disrupt systems**, and **cause damage or unauthorized access**.

### **Characteristics of Viruses**

- **Host-dependent**: A virus cannot function independently and must attach to an executable file, document macro, or boot sector.
    
- **Activation required**: It needs to be run or opened by a user to start infecting.
    
- **Spreads through file transfers, USBs, email attachments**, etc.
    
- **Can lie dormant** until triggered by certain events (e.g., a specific date).
    
- May **delete files, corrupt programs, slow down system performance**, or display annoying messages.
    
- Some viruses are **polymorphic** (change their code to avoid detection) or **metamorphic** (rewrite themselves entirely).

### **Characteristics of Worms**

- **Independent and self-replicating**: A worm does not need a host file; it can execute and spread by itself.
    
- **Network-aware**: Exploits system vulnerabilities or weak network configurations to spread (e.g., via open ports or email address books).
    
- **Spreads rapidly**, often causing **network congestion** or service downtime.
    
- Can deliver **payloads** like backdoors, ransomware, or other malware.
    
- Often used in the creation of **botnets**â€”a network of infected computers controlled remotely.
