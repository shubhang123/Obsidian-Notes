### **2. Security Terminologies and Principles**

#### **Overview**
This topic covers the essential terminologies and foundational principles used in network, computer, and cyber security. Understanding these terms and concepts is crucial for discussing and implementing security measures effectively.

#### **Security Terminologies**
Below are key terms commonly used in the field of security:

- **Asset**: Anything of value that needs protection (e.g., data, hardware, software, reputation).
- **Threat**: A potential event or action that could cause harm to an asset (e.g., malware, phishing).
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat (e.g., unpatched software, weak passwords).
- **Exploit**: A tool or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability (e.g., a script targeting a software flaw).
- **Risk**: The likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability (Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact).
- **Attack**: An intentional act to compromise security (e.g., hacking, DDoS).
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized parties (e.g., encryption).
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered (e.g., checksums, hashing).
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed (e.g., redundancy to prevent downtime).
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
- **Authorization**: Determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do (e.g., access control lists).
- **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring that a party cannot deny having performed an action (e.g., digital signatures).
- **Malware**: Malicious software like viruses, worms, ransomware, or spyware.
- **Payload**: The part of an attack that causes harm (e.g., code that deletes files in a virus).
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to bypass security (e.g., phishing emails).

#### **Security Principles**
These principles guide the design and implementation of secure systems, often referred to as the **CIA Triad** and other complementary concepts:

1. **CIA Triad**:
   - **Confidentiality**: Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
     - **Example**: Encrypting sensitive emails.
   - **Integrity**: Ensures data remains accurate and trustworthy.
     - **Example**: Using hash functions to verify file integrity.
   - **Availability**: Ensures systems and data are accessible to authorized users.
     - **Example**: Implementing backup servers to prevent downtime.

2. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Using multiple layers of security controls to protect assets (e.g., firewalls, antivirus, and user training).
   - **Example**: A bank using firewalls, encryption, and employee awareness programs to secure customer data.

3. **Least Privilege**:
   - Users and systems should have only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
   - **Example**: A junior employee only having read-only access to certain files.

4. **Separation of Duties**:
   - Dividing tasks among multiple people to prevent fraud or errors.
   - **Example**: Requiring two employees to approve a financial transaction.

5. **Fail-Safe Defaults**:
   - Systems should default to a secure state when something goes wrong.
   - **Example**: Denying access to a network if authentication fails.

6. **Economy of Mechanism**:
   - Keep security mechanisms simple to reduce errors and vulnerabilities.
   - **Example**: Using a single, well-tested encryption algorithm instead of multiple complex ones.

7. **Complete Mediation**:
   - Every access request must be checked for authorization.
   - **Example**: A system verifying user credentials for every file access, not just the first time.

8. **Open Design**:
   - Security should not rely on secrecy of the design (e.g., Kerckhoffs’ Principle: only the key should be secret, not the encryption algorithm).

#### **Why It Matters**
- **Terminologies** provide a common language for discussing security issues and solutions.
- **Principles** ensure that security measures are systematic, robust, and aligned with organizational goals.
- Together, they form the foundation for designing, implementing, and evaluating security strategies.
