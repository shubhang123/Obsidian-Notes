### **2. Security Terminologies and Principles**

#### **Overview**
This topic covers the essential terminologies and foundational principles used in network, computer, and cyber security. Understanding these terms and concepts is crucial for discussing and implementing security measures effectively.

#### **Security Terminologies**
Below are key terms commonly used in the field of security:

- **Asset**: Anything of value that needs protection (e.g., data, hardware, software, reputation).
- **Threat**: A potential event or action that could cause harm to an asset (e.g., malware, phishing).
- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat (e.g., unpatched software, weak passwords).
- **Exploit**: A tool or technique used to take advantage of a vulnerability (e.g., a script targeting a software flaw).
- **Risk**: The likelihood and impact of a threat exploiting a vulnerability (Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact).
- **Attack**: An intentional act to compromise security (e.g., hacking, DDoS).
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring data is accessible only to authorized parties (e.g., encryption).
- **Integrity**: Ensuring data is accurate and unaltered (e.g., checksums, hashing).
- **Availability**: Ensuring systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed (e.g., redundancy to prevent downtime).
- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of a user or system (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
- **Authorization**: Determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do (e.g., access control lists).
- **Non-repudiation**: Ensuring that a party cannot deny having performed an action (e.g., digital signatures).
- **Malware**: Malicious software like viruses, worms, ransomware, or spyware.
- **Payload**: The part of an attack that causes harm (e.g., code that deletes files in a virus).
- **Social Engineering**: Manipulating people to bypass security (e.g., phishing emails).

#### **Security Principles**
These principles guide the design and implementation of secure systems, often referred to as the **CIA Triad** and other complementary concepts:

1. **CIA Triad**:
   - **Confidentiality**: Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
     - **Example**: Encrypting sensitive emails.
   - **Integrity**: Ensures data remains accurate and trustworthy.
     - **Example**: Using hash functions to verify file integrity.
   - **Availability**: Ensures systems and data are accessible to authorized users.
     - **Example**: Implementing backup servers to prevent downtime.

2. **Defense in Depth**:
   - Using multiple layers of security controls to protect assets (e.g., firewalls, antivirus, and user training).
   - **Example**: A bank using firewalls, encryption, and employee awareness programs to secure customer data.

3. **Least Privilege**:
   - Users and systems should have only the minimum access necessary to perform their tasks.
   - **Example**: A junior employee only having read-only access to certain files.

4. **Separation of Duties**:
   - Dividing tasks among multiple people to prevent fraud or errors.
   - **Example**: Requiring two employees to approve a financial transaction.

5. **Fail-Safe Defaults**:
   - Systems should default to a secure state when something goes wrong.
   - **Example**: Denying access to a network if authentication fails.

6. **Economy of Mechanism**:
   - Keep security mechanisms simple to reduce errors and vulnerabilities.
   - **Example**: Using a single, well-tested encryption algorithm instead of multiple complex ones.

7. **Complete Mediation**:
   - Every access request must be checked for authorization.
   - **Example**: A system verifying user credentials for every file access, not just the first time.

8. **Open Design**:
   - Security should not rely on secrecy of the design (e.g., Kerckhoffs’ Principle: only the key should be secret, not the encryption algorithm).

#### **Why It Matters**
- **Terminologies** provide a common language for discussing security issues and solutions.
- **Principles** ensure that security measures are systematic, robust, and aligned with organizational goals.
- Together, they form the foundation for designing, implementing, and evaluating security strategies.

### **6. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

#### **Overview**
An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a security tool designed to monitor systems or networks for suspicious activities or policy violations that indicate a potential intrusion. This topic covers the purpose, functionality, and components of IDS, which are critical for detecting and responding to cyber threats.

---

#### **What is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)?**
- **Definition**: An IDS is a hardware or software solution that monitors network traffic, system activities, or logs to detect signs of unauthorized access, malicious behavior, or policy violations.
- **Purpose**:
  - Identify intrusions or attempted intrusions in real-time or near real-time.
  - Alert security teams to potential threats for further investigation.
  - Provide forensic data to analyze attacks and improve defenses.
- **Key Functions**:
  - **Monitoring**: Continuously observes network traffic, system logs, or file changes.
  - **Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns or anomalies that may indicate an attack.
  - **Alerting**: Notifies administrators via alerts (e.g., emails, dashboards) when a threat is detected.
  - **Logging**: Records events for post-incident analysis or compliance purposes.

#### **How IDS Works**
- **Data Collection**: Gathers data from network packets, system logs, or host activities.
- **Analysis**: Compares data against known attack patterns (signatures) or behavioral baselines to identify threats.
- **Response**: Generates alerts or logs events; some IDS systems may integrate with response mechanisms to block threats (e.g., Intrusion Prevention Systems, or IPS).

#### **Components of an IDS**
1. **Sensors**: Collect data from networks or hosts (e.g., packet sniffers, log analyzers).
2. **Analysis Engine**: Processes data to detect anomalies or match attack signatures.
3. **Database**: Stores known attack signatures or behavioral baselines for comparison.
4. **User Interface**: Allows administrators to view alerts, configure rules, or analyze logs.
5. **Alerting Mechanism**: Sends notifications via email, SMS, or dashboards.

#### **Key Features of IDS**
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detects threats as they occur.
- **Customizable Rules**: Allows organizations to define specific policies or thresholds.
- **Scalability**: Can monitor small networks or large enterprise environments.
- **Integration**: Works with other security tools like firewalls, SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, or IPS.

#### **Limitations of IDS**
- **False Positives**: Legitimate activities flagged as malicious, leading to alert fatigue.
- **False Negatives**: Failure to detect sophisticated or unknown attacks (e.g., zero-day exploits).
- **Resource Intensive**: May require significant processing power or storage for large networks.
- **Passive Nature**: Traditional IDS only detects and alerts, not prevents (unlike IPS).

#### **Real-World Examples**
- **Snort**: An open-source network IDS that analyzes network traffic for malicious patterns.
- **Suricata**: A high-performance IDS/IPS capable of real-time threat detection.
- **Zeek (Bro)**: A network IDS focused on analyzing traffic and generating detailed logs.

### **8. System Integrity Verifiers (SIVS)**

#### **Overview**
This topic covers **System Integrity Verifiers (SIVS)**, tools or processes used to ensure the integrity of a system by detecting unauthorized changes to critical files, configurations, or system components. SIVS are essential for identifying potential intrusions or compromises in a system.

---

#### **What are System Integrity Verifiers (SIVS)?**
- **Definition**: SIVS are security tools or mechanisms designed to monitor and verify the integrity of a system’s files, directories, and configurations by detecting unauthorized modifications, additions, or deletions.
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensure that critical system components (e.g., operating system files, configuration files, or application binaries) remain unchanged and untampered.
  - Detect signs of intrusion, such as malware altering files or attackers modifying system settings.
  - Provide forensic evidence for investigating security incidents.
- **How It Works**:
  - **Baseline Creation**: SIVS creates a baseline (snapshot) of the system’s critical files and configurations using cryptographic hashes (e.g., MD5, SHA-256).
  - **Monitoring**: Periodically or in real-time, SIVS compares the current state of files against the baseline.
  - **Alerting**: Flags any discrepancies (e.g., altered, added, or deleted files) as potential security issues.

#### **Key Features of SIVS**
- **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM)**: Tracks changes to files, including content, permissions, ownership, or timestamps.
- **Configuration Monitoring**: Verifies integrity of system settings or registry entries (e.g., Windows Registry).
- **Cryptographic Hashing**: Uses hash functions to create unique fingerprints for files, ensuring even minor changes are detected.
- **Real-Time or Scheduled Checks**: Can monitor continuously or at set intervals.
- **Reporting**: Generates alerts or logs for unauthorized changes, aiding incident response.

#### **Examples of SIVS Tools**
- **Tripwire**: A widely used open-source and commercial tool for file integrity monitoring, comparing file states against a baseline.
- **OSSEC**: An open-source HIDS with strong file integrity checking capabilities.
- **AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment)**: A Linux-based tool for monitoring file and directory integrity.
- **Samhain**: An open-source SIVS with centralized management for multiple hosts.
- **Veracode or Checkmarx**: Tools that include integrity checks for software binaries in development environments.

#### **How SIVS Detect Intrusions**
- **Malware Detection**: Identifies unauthorized changes caused by malware (e.g., a trojan modifying system binaries).
- **Rootkit Detection**: Spots hidden changes to critical files that rootkits may introduce.
- **Configuration Tampering**: Detects unauthorized changes to system settings (e.g., modified firewall rules).
- **Insider Threats**: Flags changes made by malicious insiders attempting to alter logs or configurations.

#### **Advantages of SIVS**
- **High Accuracy**: Detects even subtle changes to critical files using cryptographic hashes.
- **Forensic Value**: Provides detailed logs of changes for post-incident analysis.
- **Compliance Support**: Helps meet regulatory requirements (e.g., PCI-DSS, HIPAA) mandating integrity monitoring.
- **Proactive Detection**: Identifies compromises before they escalate into larger attacks.

#### **Limitations of SIVS**
- **Baseline Dependency**: Requires an accurate and secure baseline; a compromised baseline can hide intrusions.
- **False Positives**: Legitimate updates (e.g., software patches) may trigger alerts if not properly managed.
- **Limited Scope**: Only detects changes to monitored files, missing other attack vectors (e.g., network-based attacks).
- **Resource Usage**: Continuous monitoring can consume system resources, especially on large systems.
- **Management Overhead**: Requires regular updates to baselines and rules to account for legitimate changes.

#### **Use Cases**
- **Critical Servers**: Monitoring integrity of web servers, database servers, or domain controllers.
- **Compliance**: Ensuring systems meet standards like PCI-DSS, which require file integrity monitoring.
- **Incident Response**: Verifying whether an attacker modified files during a breach.
- **Endpoint Security**: Protecting workstations from unauthorized changes caused by malware.

#### **Real-World Example**
- A company using Tripwire detects an unauthorized change to a critical configuration file (`/etc/passwd` on a Linux server) caused by a rootkit. The SIVS alerts the security team, who isolate the server and investigate, preventing further compromise.

#### **Why It Matters**
- SIVS are a critical component of a defense-in-depth strategy, complementing IDS by focusing on system integrity.
- Early detection of unauthorized changes can prevent data breaches, system downtime, or persistent threats.
- SIVS provide a reliable way to ensure trust in system components, especially in high-security environments.

### **11. Post-Attack IDS Measures & Evading IDS Systems**

#### **Overview**
This topic covers the actions taken after an intrusion is detected by an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**, known as **post-attack IDS measures**, and the techniques attackers use to **evade IDS systems**. Understanding these aspects is crucial for improving incident response and strengthening security defenses.

---

#### **Post-Attack IDS Measures**
Post-attack IDS measures are steps taken after an IDS detects a potential intrusion to mitigate damage, investigate the incident, and prevent future attacks. These measures focus on containment, analysis, and recovery.

1. **Incident Response**:
   - **Alert Verification**: Confirm whether the IDS alert is a true positive (actual intrusion) or a false positive (legitimate activity).
     - **Example**: Cross-checking an IDS alert for unusual outbound traffic with firewall logs.
   - **Containment**: Isolate affected systems to prevent further damage.
     - **Short-Term**: Disconnect compromised hosts from the network.
     - **Long-Term**: Apply firewall rules to block malicious IPs or domains.
   - **Incident Logging**: Record all details of the alert, including timestamps, affected systems, and attack indicators.

2. **Forensic Analysis**:
   - **Log Analysis**: Review IDS logs, system logs, and network traffic to identify the attack’s scope, entry point, and impact.
     - **Tools**: Splunk, ELK Stack, or Wireshark for log and packet analysis.
   - **Evidence Collection**: Preserve data (e.g., memory dumps, disk images) for forensic investigation.
     - **Example**: Capturing a memory dump to analyze malware behavior.
   - **Timeline Reconstruction**: Build a chronology of the attack to understand how it unfolded.
