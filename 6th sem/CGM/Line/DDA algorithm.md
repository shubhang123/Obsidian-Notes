# Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Algorithm

## Theory

The Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm is used in computer graphics to draw lines between two points on a raster grid. It calculates intermediate pixel coordinates along a straight line between the start point $(x_0, y_0)$ and end point $(x_1, y_1)$ by using the difference in their $x$ and $y$ coordinates (hence "differential"). The algorithm selects the closest pixel to the ideal line path at each step, ensuring a visually smooth line on a discrete grid.

The DDA algorithm is based on the linear interpolation of coordinates. For a line, the slope $m$ is calculated as:

# $$m = \frac{y_1 - y_0}{x_1 - x_0}$$

Depending on whether the slope is less than or greater than 1, the algorithm iterates over the $x$- or $y$-axis, respectively, to minimize the number of steps and ensure accuracy. 

## Steps of the DDA Algorithm

1. Input the two endpoints: $(x_0, y_0)$ and $(x_1, y_1)$.
    
2. Calculate the differences:
    
    $$dx = x_1 - x_0, \quad dy = y_1 - y_0$$
    
3. Determine the number of steps based on the larger difference:
    
    $$\text{steps} = \max(|dx|, |dy|)$$
    
4. Calculate the increments for $x$ and $y$ per step:
    
    $$x_{\text{inc}} = \frac{dx}{\text{steps}}, \quad y_{\text{inc}} = \frac{dy}{\text{steps}}$$
    
5. Initialize the starting point: $x = x_0$, $y = y_0$.
    
6. For each step from 1 to $\text{steps}$:
    
    - Plot the pixel at $(\text{round}(x), \text{round}(y))$.
    - Update coordinates: $x = x + x_{\text{inc}}$, $y = y + y_{\text{inc}}$.

## Advantages

- **Efficiency**: Faster than direct line equations as it uses incremental calculations.
- **Precision**: Produces smoother lines by selecting the closest pixels to the true line.
- **Versatility**: Works for lines with any slope, unlike Bresenhamâ€™s algorithm, which is optimized for integer-based slopes.

## Disadvantages

- **Floating-Point Operations**: Requires floating-point arithmetic, which can be slower on hardware without floating-point support.
- **Rounding Errors**: Repeated rounding can lead to slight inaccuracies in pixel placement.
- **Complexity**: Slightly more complex than Bresenhamâ€™s algorithm due to floating-point calculations.

## Pseudocode

```c
void DDA(float x0, float y0, float x1, float y1) {
    float dx = x1 - x0, dy = y1 - y0;
    float steps = max(abs(dx), abs(dy));
    float x_inc = dx / steps, y_inc = dy / steps;
    float x = x0, y = y0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= steps; i++) {
        plot(round(x), round(y));
        x += x_inc;
        y += y_inc;
    }
}
```

## ðŸ“Œ **Question**

**Draw a line using the DDA algorithm from point**  
$(x_0, y_0) = (2, 3)$ **to** $(x_1, y_1) = (10, 8)$  
Show all intermediate steps and the points plotted.

## ðŸ§® **Step-by-Step Solution**

### 1. **Calculate $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$**

$\Delta x = x_1 - x_0 = 10 - 2 = 8$  
$\Delta y = y_1 - y_0 = 8 - 3 = 5$

---

### 2. **Determine number of steps**

$\text{steps} = \max(|\Delta x|, |\Delta y|) = \max(8, 5) = 8$

---

### 3. **Calculate increments**

### $x_{\text{increment}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\text{steps}} = \frac{8}{8} = 1$  
### $y_{\text{increment}} = \frac{\Delta y}{\text{steps}} = \frac{5}{8} = 0.625$

---

### 4. **Initialize starting point**

$x = x_0 = 2$, $y = y_0 = 3$

---

### 5. **Plot each step**

Loop from $i = 0$ to $i = 8$:

|$i$|$x$ (float)|$y$ (float)|Plotted Point (rounded)|
|---|---|---|---|
|$0$|$2.000$|$3.000$|$(2, 3)$|
|$1$|$3.000$|$3.625$|$(3, 4)$|
|$2$|$4.000$|$4.250$|$(4, 4)$|
|$3$|$5.000$|$4.875$|$(5, 5)$|
|$4$|$6.000$|$5.500$|$(6, 6)$|
|$5$|$7.000$|$6.125$|$(7, 6)$|
|$6$|$8.000$|$6.750$|$(8, 7)$|
|$7$|$9.000$|$7.375$|$(9, 7)$|
|$8$|$10.000$|$8.000$|$(10, 8)$|

## ðŸ“˜ **Conclusion**

The DDA algorithm calculates points using fractional increments:  
$x$ increases by $1$ and $y$ increases by $0.625$ in each step.  
The plotted integer coordinates form a smooth approximation of the actual line.
