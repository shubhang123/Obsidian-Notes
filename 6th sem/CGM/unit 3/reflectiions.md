Diffuse and specular reflection are two fundamental ways that light interacts with surfaces, each producing very different visual effects.

**Specular Reflection** occurs when light rays hit a smooth surface and reflect at equal angles - the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. This creates mirror-like reflections where you can see clear images of light sources or objects. Examples include mirrors, calm water, polished metal, or glossy paint. The reflected light maintains its coherence and directionality.

**Diffuse Reflection** happens when light hits a rough or textured surface and scatters in many different directions. Instead of creating mirror images, this produces even illumination that allows us to see the surface itself from multiple viewing angles. Examples include matte paint, paper, unpolished wood, or fabric. The surface appears uniformly lit rather than showing bright reflective spots.

Most real-world surfaces exhibit a combination of both types. A semi-gloss paint, for instance, has both diffuse properties (you can see the painted surface) and some specular qualities (slight shininess). The ratio between diffuse and specular reflection determines how matte or glossy a material appears.

This distinction is crucial in computer graphics, photography, and lighting design. In 3D rendering, materials are often defined by their diffuse and specular components, with additional parameters controlling how sharp or broad the specular highlights appear.
