I understand that you're having an issue where mathematical expressions are not rendering correctly in Obsidian using dollar signs (`$`). Obsidian supports LaTeX for math rendering, where inline math should be enclosed in single dollar signs (`$ ... $`) and display math in double dollar signs (`$$ ... $$`). It seems like the content you’re working with might not be using these delimiters consistently, which could explain why it’s not rendering as expected. Let me clarify how to fix this and provide an example tailored for Obsidian.

### Why the Issue Might Be Happening
Obsidian expects:
- **Inline math**: `$expression$` (e.g., `$x + y$`) to render within the text.
- **Display math**: `$$expression$$` (e.g., `$$x + y = z$$`) to render on a separate line, often centered.

If the content uses other delimiters like `\( ... \)` for inline math or `\[ ... \]` for display math (common in other LaTeX environments), it might not render properly in Obsidian unless explicitly supported by a plugin or setting. To ensure compatibility, we’ll stick strictly to `$ ... $` and `$$ ... $$`.

### How to Fix It
To make sure your math renders correctly in Obsidian:
1. Use `$ ... $` for all inline mathematical expressions (e.g., variables or short formulas within a sentence).
2. Use `$$ ... $$` for larger equations or matrices that should appear on their own line.
3. Check for stray characters, spaces, or missing delimiters that might break the rendering.

### Example: Transformations in 2D for Obsidian
Here’s a sample of how mathematical content should be formatted for Obsidian rendering, using a common topic like 2D transformations:

#### Translation
Translation shifts a point $(x, y)$ by distances $t_x$ and $t_y$. The new coordinates are:
- Inline: $x' = x + t_x$ and $y' = y + t_y$.
- Display (vector form):
  $$
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x' \\
  y'
  \end{bmatrix}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  x \\
  y
  \end{bmatrix}
  +
  \begin{bmatrix}
  t_x \\
  t_y
  \end{bmatrix}
  $$

#### Rotation
Rotation by an angle $\theta$ uses this matrix:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{bmatrix}
$$
The transformed coordinates are $x' = x \cos\theta - y \sin\theta$ and $y' = x \sin\theta + y \cos\theta$.

#### Scaling
Scaling with factors $s_x$ and $s_y$ is written as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y'
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
s_x & 0 \\
0 & s_y
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y
\end{bmatrix}
$$
So, $x' = s_x x$ and $y' = s_y y$.

### Applying This to Your Content
If you share the specific text that isn’t rendering, I can adjust it for you. For now, I recommend:
- Replacing any `\( ... \)` with `$ ... $` for inline math.
- Replacing any `\[ ... \]` with `$$ ... $$` for display math.
- Ensuring no extra spaces or typos exist between the delimiters and the math content (e.g., `$ x $` won’t work; use `$x$`).

### Testing in Obsidian
Copy the example above into an Obsidian note and preview it. If it renders correctly (inline math within the text, display math on separate lines), then the `$` and `$$` syntax is working as expected. If it still doesn’t render, there might be an issue with your Obsidian settings (e.g., LaTeX rendering disabled) or a plugin conflict—let me know, and I can troubleshoot further!
