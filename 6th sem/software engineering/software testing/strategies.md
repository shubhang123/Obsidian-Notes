Software testing strategies provide a crucial roadmap for effective software development, outlining the steps, timing, effort, and resources required for testing. This process is essential for uncovering errors and ensuring the quality of the software.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the key aspects of software testing strategies:

### Verification and Validation

Software testing is an integral part of **Verification and Validation (V&V)**, a broader concept aimed at ensuring software quality.

- **Verification** refers to the set of tasks that ensure the software correctly implements a specific function or requirement. It answers the question: **"Are we building the product right?"**.
- **Validation** refers to a different set of tasks that ensure the software built is traceable to customer requirements. It addresses the question: **"Are we building the right product?"**.

V&V encompasses a wide array of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) activities, including:

- Technical reviews.
- Quality and configuration audits.
- Performance monitoring.
- Simulation.
- Feasibility studies.
- Documentation review.
- Database review.
- Algorithm analysis.
- Development testing.
- Usability testing.
- Qualification testing.
- Acceptance testing.
- Installation testing.

While testing plays a vital role in V&V, some perspectives suggest that all testing constitutes verification, and validation is primarily conducted through requirements review, approval, and user acceptance.

### Strategic Issues in Software Testing

An effective software testing strategy needs to be flexible enough to allow for customised approaches, yet rigid enough to encourage systematic testing. **Generic Characteristics of Testing Strategies**:

- **Effective technical reviews** should be conducted as a precursor to testing to eliminate many errors beforehand.
- Testing initiates at the **component level** and progresses "outward" towards the integration of the entire computer-based system.
- Different testing techniques are appropriate for various software engineering approaches and at different stages.
- Testing is performed by both the **software developer** and, for larger projects, an **independent test group (ITG)**, which offers an objective perspective without the "conflict of interest" developers might have.
- **Debugging** is a distinct activity from testing but must be integrated into any testing strategy.

**The Overall Testing Strategy (The Big Picture)**: Testing within the context of software engineering is viewed as a **series of four sequential steps**, spiralling outwards to broaden the scope of testing with each turn:

1. **Unit Testing**: This is the initial step, focusing on individual components to ensure they function properly as a unit. It heavily uses techniques that exercise specific paths in a component's control structure for comprehensive coverage and error detection.
2. **Integration Testing**: After components are unit tested, they are assembled or integrated. This phase addresses issues related to verification and program construction. Test case design for integration focuses on inputs and outputs, though path-exercising techniques may be used for major control paths.
3. **Validation Testing**: Once the software is integrated, high-order tests are conducted to evaluate validation criteria established during requirements analysis. This provides final assurance that the software meets all functional, behavioural, and performance requirements.
4. **System Testing**: The final high-order testing step, which falls within the broader context of computer system engineering, verifies that the software, combined with other system elements (e.g., hardware, people, databases), meshes properly and achieves overall system function and performance.

**Guidelines for a Successful Software Testing Strategy** (as suggested by Tom Gilb):

- Specify **quantifiable product requirements** well before testing begins.
- Explicitly state **testing objectives**.
- Understand the **software users** and develop a profile for each user category.
- Develop a testing plan that emphasises **"rapid cycle testing"** (short, iterative tests providing quick feedback for quality control).
- Build **"robust" software** designed to test itself (antibugging).
- Utilise **effective technical reviews** as a filter prior to testing.
- Conduct technical reviews to **assess the test strategy and test cases** themselves.
- Develop a **continuous improvement approach** for the testing process.

### Test Plan

A **Test Specification** (also referred to as a Test Plan) is a critical work product that documents the software team's approach to testing.

- It outlines an **overall strategy** and a **detailed procedure** for specific testing steps and the types of tests to be conducted.
- It defines the **testing task set** and the work products to be developed.
- The test plan also identifies **test phases and builds** that address specific functional and behavioural characteristics of the software.
- It describes the **test environment and resources**, including any unusual hardware configurations, simulators, or special tools/techniques.
- A detailed testing procedure outlines the **order of integration and corresponding tests** at each step.
- It includes a **listing of all test cases (annotated for reference)** and their **expected results**.
- A **Test Report**, detailing actual test results, problems, or peculiarities, can be appended to the Test Specification, providing vital information for software maintenance.
- Reviewing the Test Specification prior to testing allows for the assessment of the completeness of test cases and tasks, leading to the orderly construction of software and early error discovery.
- The **SQA Plan** (Software Quality Assurance Plan) provides a roadmap for instituting SQA, outlining evaluations, audits, reviews, applicable standards, error reporting procedures, SQA group work products, and feedback mechanisms.

### Test Case Design

The primary objective of test case design is to derive a set of tests with the **highest likelihood of uncovering errors** in software. It provides systematic guidance for creating tests that exercise both the internal logic and interfaces of components and the input and output domains of the program.

Test case design for conventional applications typically involves two main categories:

1. **White-Box Testing**:
    
    - **Focus**: This approach concentrates on the **internal program logic and structure**. Test cases are derived to ensure that all statements in the program have been executed at least once and that all logical conditions have been exercised.
    - **Applicability**: White-box tests can only be designed once component-level design or source code exists, as they require knowledge of the program's logical details.
    - **Techniques**:
        - **Basis Path Testing**: Uses flow graph notation to identify independent program paths and derive test cases to ensure complete statement coverage.
        - **Control Structure Testing**: Focuses on control structures within the program.
2. **Black-Box Testing**:
    
    - **Focus**: This approach exercises **software requirements** by focusing on the input and output domains of the program to uncover errors in function, behaviour, and performance. It does not consider the internal logical structure of the program.
    - **Applicability**: Black-box testing is applicable throughout the software testing process, including unit, integration, validation, and system testing.
    - **Techniques**:
        - **Graph-Based Testing Methods**: Uses diagrams (e.g., control flow, data flow) to derive tests.
        - **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divides the input domain into classes where test cases are likely to exercise a specific software function.
        - **Boundary Value Analysis**: Probes the program's ability to handle data at the limits of acceptability.
        - **Orthogonal Array Testing**: An efficient method for testing systems with a small number of input parameters.

**Other Test Design Approaches**:

- **Model-Based Testing (MBT)**: Uses elements of the requirements model to test the behaviour of an application, particularly useful for event-driven applications. It involves reviewing behavioral models, specifying inputs/test cases, noting expected outputs, executing tests, and comparing results.
- **Testing Documentation and Help Facilities**: Errors in documentation can be as detrimental as code errors, thus documentation testing (technical review and live testing) is a meaningful part of every test plan.
- **Patterns for Software Testing**: These can help software teams communicate more effectively about testing. An example is **ScenarioTesting**, which exercises the software from the user's point of view to determine if it satisfies user-visible requirements.

**Characteristics of a "Good" Test**:

- A high probability of finding an error.
- Not redundant.
- Neither too simple nor too complex.

When performing testing, it's crucial to adopt a mindset to "break" the software, designing test cases in a disciplined fashion and reviewing them for thoroughness. Evaluating test coverage and tracking error detection activities are also key.
