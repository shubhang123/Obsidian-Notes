### **Part 1: The Theory - Finding the Diameter of a Tree**

The goal of your code is to find the **diameter** of the tree.

**Definition: Diameter of a Tree**
The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. The length of this path is the number of edges it contains.

**The Two-Pass DFS Algorithm**
This is a standard and very efficient method to find the diameter. It is based on a powerful property of trees:

**Theorem:** For any arbitrary node `s` in a tree, the node `A` that is farthest from `s` is guaranteed to be an endpoint of at least one of the tree's diameters.

This theorem allows for a simple, two-step algorithm:

1.  **First DFS Pass:**
    *   Pick any node in the tree (e.g., Node 1) and consider it a temporary root.
    *   Run a DFS from this node to calculate the distance (which is the same as depth from this temporary root) to all other nodes.
    *   Find the node that has the maximum distance. Let's call this node `endpoint_A`. Based on the theorem, we now know `endpoint_A` is one end of the true diameter.

2.  **Second DFS Pass:**
    *   Now, we know one endpoint of the diameter. To find the other, we simply need to find the node that is farthest away from `endpoint_A`.
    *   Run a second DFS, this time starting from `endpoint_A`. Calculate the distance from `endpoint_A` to all other nodes.
    *   The maximum distance found in this second pass is the length of the longest path starting from `endpoint_A`. Since `endpoint_A` is a diameter endpoint, this longest path is the diameter itself.

Your code implements this exact logic.

### **Part 2: Analysis of Your `dfs` Function (The Global Array Style)**

Your `dfs` function is designed to work with a shared, global `depth` array. Let's analyze it very closely.

```cpp
// Your original dfs function
void dfs(int vertex, int parent) {
    for (int child : g[vertex]) {
        if (child == parent) continue;
        
        // This is the most important line to understand.
        depth[child] += depth[vertex] + 1; 
        
        dfs(child, vertex);
    }
}
```

**How it Works (and Why it's Fragile):**

The correctness of the line `depth[child] += depth[vertex] + 1;` is **entirely dependent on the state of the `depth` array *before* the DFS call starts.**

Let's trace it for the first DFS call, `dfs(1, 0)`.
*   **Pre-condition:** Your `main` function has either let the global `depth` array initialize to all zeros, or you have manually reset it to zeros. This is a critical assumption.
*   **Inside `dfs(1, 0)`:**
    *   The `vertex` is 1, `parent` is 0.
    *   `depth[1]` is currently `0`.
    *   Let's say the first child is `2`. The code executes: `depth[2] += depth[1] + 1;`
    *   This translates to: `depth[2] = 0 + 0 + 1;`, so `depth[2]` becomes `1`. This is correct.
*   **The recursive call `dfs(2, 1)` is made:**
    *   The `vertex` is 2, `parent` is 1.
    *   `depth[2]` is currently `1`.
    *   Let's say the first child of 2 is `4`. The code executes: `depth[4] += depth[2] + 1;`
    *   This translates to: `depth[4] = 0 + 1 + 1;`, so `depth[4]` becomes `2`. This is also correct.

**The Subtle "Bug" and A Better Way:**

While your `+=` version works *because* you reset the array, it's not expressing the true logic. The logic is: "The depth of a child **is** the depth of its parent plus one."

The line should be an **assignment**, not an addition:
`depth[child] = depth[vertex] + 1;`

This small change makes the function's logic much clearer and more robust. It correctly states the relationship between a parent's and child's depth, independent of the child's previous value.

Your `main` function's reset loop saves the `+=` logic from failing, but `depth[child] = ...` is the semantically correct and safer way to write it.

### **Part 3: Code with Detailed Notes 

Here is the full code, with the one small but important correction in `dfs`, and with extensive notes explaining every part of the process, preserving your style of using a global array.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

// Use a slightly safer constant definition
const int N = 100005;

// ---- GLOBAL STATE ----
// g: The adjacency list to represent the tree.
// depth: A global array to store the calculated distances (depths) from the starting node of a DFS pass.
// The correctness of our DFS relies on this array being in a known state (all zeros) before each pass.
std::vector<int> g[N];
int depth[N];

/**
 * @brief Calculates distances from a starting 'vertex' using DFS.
 * 
 * This function works by reading the parent's depth from the global 'depth' array
 * and calculating the child's depth before making the recursive call.
 * This is a "pre-order" calculation.
 * 
 * @param vertex The current node being visited.
 * @param parent The parent of the current node (to avoid going backward).
 */
void dfs(int vertex, int parent) {
    // Loop through all nodes connected to the current 'vertex'
    for (int child : g[vertex]) {
        // If the connected node is the one we just came from, skip it.
        if (child == parent) {
            continue;
        }

        // --- CORE LOGIC ---
        // The depth of a child node is exactly 1 more than the depth of its parent.
        // We set the child's depth BEFORE we visit it with the recursive call.
        // This is the correct way to express the relationship. Your `+=` version
        // also worked, but only because the array was reset to zeros each time.
        // This assignment `=` is clearer and more robust.
        depth[child] = depth[vertex] + 1;

        // Recurse on the child node.
        dfs(child, vertex);
    }
}

int main() {
    std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    std::cin.tie(NULL);

    int n;
    std::cin >> n;

    // Read the n-1 edges of the tree.
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int x, y;
        std::cin >> x >> y;
        g[x].push_back(y);
        g[y].push_back(x);
    }

    // So, depth[1] is 0, which is the correct depth for the root.
    dfs(1, 0);

    int max_depth_val = -1;
    int max_depth_node = -1;

    // Find the node that is farthest from node 1.
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        depth[i] = 0;
    }

    // Now, run DFS again, but this time starting from the known endpoint.
    dfs(max_depth_node, 0);
