# DFS Connected Components - Study Notes

## Problem Overview

This code counts the number of **connected components** in an undirected graph using Depth-First Search (DFS).

### What is a Connected Component?

A connected component is a maximal set of vertices where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex through some path of edges.

## Code Structure Analysis

### 1. Headers and Global Variables

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1e5 + 10;  // Maximum number of vertices (100,010)
vector<int> g[N];        // Adjacency list representation
bool vis[N];             // Visited array to track explored vertices
```

**Key Points:**

- Uses adjacency list for efficient graph representation
- Global arrays for easy access across functions
- `N = 1e5 + 10` provides buffer space beyond the maximum constraint

### 2. DFS Function

```cpp
void dfs(int vertex) {
    vis[vertex] = true;  // Mark current vertex as visited
    
    for (int child : g[vertex]) {
        if (vis[child]) continue;  // Skip already visited vertices
        dfs(child);                // Recursively explore unvisited children
    }
}
```

**DFS Traversal Process:**

1. Mark current vertex as visited
2. Explore all unvisited adjacent vertices recursively
3. The commented sections show where you can add custom logic:
    - Before entering a vertex
    - Before/after exploring each child
    - Before exiting a vertex

### 3. Main Function Logic

```cpp
int main() {
    // Input: number of vertices (v) and edges (e)
    int v, e;
    cin >> v >> e;
    
    // Build adjacency list for undirected graph
    for (int i = 0; i < e; i++) {
        int v1, v2;
        cin >> v1 >> v2;
        g[v1].push_back(v2);  // Add edge v1 -> v2
        g[v2].push_back(v1);  // Add edge v2 -> v1 (undirected)
    }
    
    // Count connected components
    int cnt = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i <= v; i++) {
        if (vis[i]) continue;  // Skip if already visited
        dfs(i);                // Explore entire component
        cnt++;                 // Increment component count
    }
    
    cout << cnt << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Algorithm Walkthrough

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Input Processing**: Read graph structure into adjacency list
2. **Component Detection**: For each unvisited vertex:
    - Start DFS from that vertex
    - DFS will visit all vertices in the same component
    - Increment component counter
3. **Output**: Total number of connected components

### Example Execution:

```
Input:
6 4
1 2
2 3
4 5
5 6

Graph Structure:
1 - 2 - 3    4 - 5 - 6
```

**Execution Flow:**

- Start with vertex 1 (unvisited) → DFS visits 1, 2, 3 → cnt = 1
- Check vertex 2 (already visited) → skip
- Check vertex 3 (already visited) → skip
- Start with vertex 4 (unvisited) → DFS visits 4, 5, 6 → cnt = 2
- Remaining vertices already visited
- **Output: 2 components**

## Time & Space Complexity

### Time Complexity: O(V + E)

- Each vertex is visited exactly once
- Each edge is traversed exactly twice (once from each endpoint)
- V = number of vertices, E = number of edges

### Space Complexity: O(V + E)

- Adjacency list storage: O(V + E)
- Visited array: O(V)
- DFS recursion stack: O(V) in worst case (linear graph)

## Key Programming Concepts

### 1. Graph Representation

- **Adjacency List**: Efficient for sparse graphs
- **Undirected Graph**: Each edge added in both directions

### 2. DFS Properties

- **Recursive**: Uses function call stack
- **Backtracking**: Explores as deep as possible before backtracking
- **Visited Tracking**: Prevents infinite loops and revisiting

### 3. Connected Component Detection

- **Union of DFS Trees**: Each DFS call explores one complete component
- **Counting Strategy**: Number of DFS calls = Number of components

## Common Applications

1. **Network Analysis**: Finding isolated networks
2. **Social Networks**: Identifying friend groups
3. **Maze Problems**: Finding separate regions
4. **Circuit Analysis**: Identifying disconnected circuits
5. **Geographic Analysis**: Finding isolated land masses

## Potential Modifications

### 1. Component Size Tracking

```cpp
int component_size = 0;
void dfs(int vertex) {
    vis[vertex] = true;
    component_size++;  // Track size of current component
    // ... rest of DFS
}
```

### 2. Storing Component Members

```cpp
vector<int> current_component;
void dfs(int vertex) {
    vis[vertex] = true;
    current_component.push_back(vertex);
    // ... rest of DFS
}
```

### 3. Finding Largest Component

```cpp
int max_component_size = 0;
// In main loop:
component_size = 0;
dfs(i);
max_component_size = max(max_component_size, component_size);
```

## Important Notes

- **1-indexed vertices**: Loop runs from 1 to v (not 0 to v-1)
- **Global arrays**: Automatically initialized to false/0
- **Undirected graph**: Each edge creates bidirectional connections
- **DFS vs BFS**: Both work for connectivity; DFS uses less memory
- **Stack overflow**: Very deep recursion might cause issues with large linear graphs
