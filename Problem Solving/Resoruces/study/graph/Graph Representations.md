there are mainly two representations of graph  which include adjacency matrix and adjacency list.

adjacency matrix 

its space complexity is n^2  also it cant store values up to 10 ^ 4 max, but it is easier to find the connections in graph as it is o(1) action, as well as easier to store the weights of a graph
