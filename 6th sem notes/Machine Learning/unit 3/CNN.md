## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning architecture designed for processing grid-like data, such as images or time-series, by leveraging spatial structures to extract features efficiently. CNNs are widely used in tasks like image classification, object detection, and facial recognition.

### What is a CNN?

A CNN uses **convolutional layers** to apply filters that detect spatial patterns (e.g., edges, textures) in the input data. Unlike fully connected networks, CNNs reduce parameters through **weight sharing** and exploit the spatial hierarchy of data, making them ideal for visual tasks.

**Key Roles:**
- **Feature Extraction:** Automatically learns features like edges or shapes from raw data.
- **Efficiency:** Reduces the number of parameters compared to fully connected networks.
- **Translation Invariance:** Captures patterns regardless of their position in the input.

### Architecture of a CNN

A CNN consists of several layer types, each with a specific function in feature extraction and prediction.

#### 1. Convolutional Layer
- **Purpose:** Extracts features by applying a convolution operation, where a filter slides over the input to produce a feature map.
- **Formula:** For an input $X$ and filter $W$, the output at position $(i,j)$ of feature map $Z$ is:
  \[
  ## $Z[i,j] = \sum_m \sum_n X[i+m, j+n] \cdot W[m,n] + b$
  \]
  - **Explanation of Terms:**
    - $X[i+m, j+n]$: The input value at position $(i+m, j+n)$, typically a pixel in an image.
    - $W[m,n]$: The weight of the filter at position $(m,n)$, shared across the input to reduce parameters.
    - $b$: A bias term added to the convolution output.
    - $Z[i,j]$: The value in the feature map, representing the presence of a pattern (e.g., an edge) at position $(i,j)$.
- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Filter/Kernel:** A small matrix (e.g., $3 \times 3$) that detects specific patterns.
  - **Stride:** The step size of the filter (e.g., stride $s=1$ moves one pixel at a time).
  - **Padding:** Adds zeros around the input (e.g., "same" padding ensures $H_{\text{out}} = H_{\text{in}}$).
  - **Output Size:** For input height $H$, width $W$, filter size $k$, stride $s$, and padding $p$, the output height is:
    \[
    ## $H_{\text{out}} = \left\lfloor \frac{H - k + 2p}{s} \right\rfloor + 1$
    \]

#### 2. Activation Layer
- **Purpose:** Introduces non-linearity to capture complex patterns.
- **Common Function:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit):
  \[
 ## $f(x) = \max(0, x)$
  \]
  - **Explanation:** Sets negative values to 0, keeping positive values unchanged. This non-linearity helps the network learn complex relationships and avoids issues with purely linear transformations.

#### 3. Pooling Layer
- **Purpose:** Reduces spatial dimensions (downsampling) to lower computational cost and prevent overfitting.
- **Types:**
  - **Max Pooling:** Takes the maximum value in a region.
  - **Average Pooling:** Takes the average value in a region.
- **Formula (Max Pooling):** For a 2x2 window with stride 2:
  \[
  ## $P[i,j] = \max(X[2i:2i+2, 2j:2j+2])$
  \]
  - **Explanation:** For each 2x2 region, $P[i,j]$ is the largest value, reducing the spatial size by half (e.g., a 4x4 input becomes 2x2).
- **Role:** Provides translation invariance (e.g., a feature is detected regardless of its exact position) and reduces the risk of overfitting by summarizing regions.

#### 4. Fully Connected Layer
- **Purpose:** Combines features for tasks like classification.
- **Operation:** Flattens the feature maps into a vector and applies a dense layer:
  \[
  ## $y = W \cdot \text{flatten}(Z) + b$
  \]
  - **Explanation:**
    - $\text{flatten}(Z)$: Converts the 2D feature map into a 1D vector.
    - $W$: Weight matrix of the fully connected layer.
    - $b$: Bias vector.
    - $y$: Output vector, often representing class scores.
- **Output for Classification:** Uses softmax to compute probabilities:
  
  ## $\text{softmax}(y)_i = \frac{e^{y_i}}{\sum_j e^{y_j}}$
  
  - **Explanation:** Converts scores $y_i$ into probabilities, where $\text{softmax}(y)_i$ is the probability of class $i$.

#### 5. Batch Normalization (Optional)
- **Purpose:** Stabilizes training by normalizing layer inputs (as discussed previously).
- **Formula:**
  \[
  \hat{x}_i = \frac{x_i - \mu_B}{\sqrt{\sigma_B^2 + \epsilon}}, \quad y_i = \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta
  \]
  - **Explanation:**
    - $\mu_B = \frac{1}{m} \sum x_i$: Mean of the mini-batch.
    - $\sigma_B^2 = \frac{1}{m} \sum (x_i - \mu_B)^2$: Variance of the mini-batch.
    - $\epsilon$: Small constant for numerical stability.
    - $\gamma, \beta$: Learnable parameters for scaling and shifting.
  - **Role:** Ensures inputs to each layer have a stable distribution, improving training speed and stability.

### Typical CNN Architecture
- Input → [Conv → ReLU → Pool] (repeated) → Flatten → Fully Connected → Output
- Example: An image of size $28 \times 28 \times 1$ (grayscale) might pass through multiple layers to output probabilities over 10 classes (e.g., digits 0-9).

## Training a CNN

CNNs are trained using **backpropagation**, with modifications for convolutional and pooling layers.

### Process
1. **Forward Pass:**
   - Compute predictions by applying convolution, activation, pooling, and fully connected layers.
   - Calculate the loss, e.g., cross-entropy for classification:
     \[
     L = -\sum_i y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)
     \]
     - **Explanation:** $y_i$ is the true label (1 for the correct class, 0 otherwise), and $\hat{y}_i$ is the predicted probability. The loss measures the difference between predictions and true labels.
2. **Backward Pass (Backpropagation):**
   - Compute gradients of the loss with respect to all parameters:
     \[
     \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}, \quad \frac{\partial L}{\partial b}
     \]
     - **Explanation:** Gradients indicate how much each parameter contributes to the loss, computed using the chain rule across layers.
   - Update parameters using gradient descent:
     \[
     W \leftarrow W - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}
     \]
     - **Explanation:** $\eta$ is the learning rate, controlling the step size of the update.
3. **Iterate:** Repeat over multiple epochs using mini-batches.

### Connection to Previous Concepts
- **Backpropagation:** Computes gradients for convolutional layers, similar to fully connected layers (as discussed earlier).
- **Regularization:** Applies L2 regularization to the loss:
  \[
  L_{\text{total}} = L + \lambda \sum W^2
  \]
  - **Explanation:** $\lambda$ controls the strength of the penalty, preventing large weights and overfitting.
- **Batch Normalization:** Normalizes activations within each layer, as previously covered.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Involves tuning $\eta$, filter sizes, number of layers, etc.
