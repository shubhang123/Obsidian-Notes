In Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the **flattening layer** and **fully connected layers** work together to transition from feature extraction to classification or regression.

### Flattening Layer

The **flattening layer** is a process that transforms the multi-dimensional output from the convolutional and pooling layers into a one-dimensional (1D) vector.

- **Purpose**: Its primary purpose is to prepare the data to be fed as input to the fully connected layers. Convolutional and pooling layers output 3D feature maps (e.g., [height, width, channels]). Fully connected layers, being traditional neural network layers, typically expect a 1D vector as input.
- **How it works**: It essentially "unrolls" the 3D feature map into a single long vector. For example, a feature map with dimensions 5×5×16 (height=5, width=5, channels=16) is flattened into a 400×1 vector (5*5*16=400).
- **Placement**: Flattening is typically performed after one or more sequences of convolutional and pooling layers and directly before the first fully connected layer.

### Fully Connected Layer

**Fully connected layers** (also known as Dense layers in some frameworks like Keras) are traditional neural network layers that operate on the high-level features extracted by the preceding convolutional and pooling layers.

- **Purpose**: Their main role is to **perform classification or regression** based on the features learned from the input data. In a CNN architecture, the convolution and pooling layers primarily act as feature extractors, while the fully connected layers act as the classifier.
- **How it works**:
    - In a fully connected layer, **each neuron in the input is connected to every neuron in the output**. This means that every input feature contributes to every output of that layer.
    - They take the **flattened output** from the convolutional and pooling layers as their input.
    - They introduce **non-linearity** into the network, allowing it to learn complex patterns, often using activation functions like ReLU in hidden layers and Softmax or Sigmoid in the output layer.
- **Placement and Activation Functions**:
    - After flattening, the 1D vector is fed into one or more fully connected layers.
    - For **multiclass classification tasks**, the **Softmax activation function** is commonly used in the last (output) fully connected layer. The Softmax function calculates the probability distribution over 'n' different events, determining the probabilities of each target class across all possible target classes, which helps identify the target class for given inputs.
    - For **binary classification**, the **Sigmoid activation function** is typically used in the output layer.
    - For hidden fully connected layers, the **ReLU activation function** or its variants (like Leaky ReLU) are often recommended.

In essence, the flattening layer serves as a bridge, transforming the spatially organised features from convolutional and pooling operations into a format suitable for the fully connected layers, which then make the final classification or regression decision.
