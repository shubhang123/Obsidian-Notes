The **loss layer**, also referred to as the **cost function**, within a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is responsible for **quantifying the error between the network's predictions and the actual ground truth labels** in the training data.

Its primary purpose is to **measure how "wrong" the network's predictions are**. The fundamental goal of training a neural network is to **minimize this calculated loss** by iteratively adjusting the network's weights and biases. The loss function helps to define the optimization objective.

Common loss functions used in CNNs include:

- **Cross-Entropy Loss**:
    
    - It is primarily used for **classification tasks**.
    - This function measures the **dissimilarity between the predicted probability distribution over the classes and the true distribution**. For the true distribution, the correct class has a probability of 1, and others have 0.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**:
    
    - It is commonly used for **regression tasks**, where the objective is to predict continuous values.
    - MSE calculates the **average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values**.
    - As discussed in our previous conversation, MSE is also used as a cost function in linear regression, where the model aims to minimize it to find the best-fit line. A smaller MSE indicates that the model is closer to finding the line of best fit. If MSE were used as a cost function in logistic regression, it would result in a non-convex function with many local minimums, making optimization difficult.
