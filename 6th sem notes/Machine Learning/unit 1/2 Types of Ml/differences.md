|**Aspect**|**Supervised Learning**|**Unsupervised Learning**|**Reinforcement Learning**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A machine learning paradigm where the model learns to map input data to corresponding output labels using a labeled dataset.|A machine learning paradigm that identifies patterns or structures in unlabeled data without predefined outputs.|A machine learning paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment to maximize cumulative rewards.|

|**Objective**|Minimize prediction error between model outputs and true labels (e.g., reduce Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy Loss).|Discover inherent patterns, such as clusters, reduced dimensions, or associations, without explicit guidance.|Maximize cumulative reward over time by learning an optimal policy for decision-making.|
|**Input**|Features (x) and corresponding labels (y). Example: House features (size, location) and price.|Features (x) only. Example: Customer purchase histories without categories.|States (s), actions (a), and rewards (r). Example: Game board state, move, and score.|
|**Output**|Predicted labels or values (discrete for classification, continuous for regression).|Clusters, reduced dimensions, or association rules.|Policy (π) or value function (V(s) or Q(s,a)) guiding actions.|
|**Learning Process**|Trains on labeled data to generalize to new inputs; uses loss functions to optimize predictions.|Analyzes unlabeled data to group or simplify it; optimizes intrinsic objectives (e.g., minimize within-cluster variance).|Learns through trial-and-error, balancing exploration and exploitation to optimize long-term rewards.|
