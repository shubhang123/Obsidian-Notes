Cost function is used to measure the accuracy of the mapping function, which maps the input variable to the output variable.  
This mapping function is also known as the hypothesis function.  

By finding the best-fit regression line, the model aims to predict the $y$ value such that the error between the predicted value and the true value is minimized.  
Therefore, the parameters $b_0$ and $b_1$ are updated to reach the values that minimize the error between the predicted $y$ value and the actual $y$ value.

For linear regression, we use the Mean Squared Error (MSE) cost function, which is the average of the squared errors between the predicted $y$ values and the actual $y$ values.
