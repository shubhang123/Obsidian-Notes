# Waterfall Model

The **Waterfall Model** is the simplest Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model in which phases are organized in a **linear and sequential** manner.  
It is called the **Waterfall Model** because its diagrammatic representation resembles a waterfall. It is also known as the **Classical Life Cycle Model**.

This model is mainly used for **small to medium-sized projects** with **clear, well-defined requirements**, where the technology and tools to be used are **well-known and stable**.  
It is suitable for projects where **minimal changes are expected** during development and where **predictability** is prioritized.



---

### Advantages

- Easy to understand and implement, with well-defined stages and clear milestones.
    
- Each phase has a well-defined input and output; phases are processed and completed one at a time without overlap.
    
- Low cost and easy to schedule, as all team members are not required to work concurrently‚Äîallowing them to work on multiple projects.
    

---

### Disadvantages

- Not suitable for accommodating changes or iterations once development has started.
    
- Difficult to gather complete and accurate requirements at the beginning.
    
- Working software is produced only at the final phase, making it unsuitable for **large, sophisticated projects**.
    
- High levels of risk and uncertainty.

# Prototype Model

In many cases, customers are **unsure about the exact functionality** they want in the software. As a result, the final product may not match their expectations.

The **Prototype Model** is an **iterative** software development approach that involves building an **early working model** (prototype) of the system with **limited functionality**, **low reliability**, and **unverified performance**.

The prototype is then **shown to the user**, who provides feedback. Based on this feedback, the prototype is **modified and rebuilt**, and the updated version is again presented to the user. This **loop continues** until the customer is satisfied.

Once the prototype has been refined to the point where the user is satisfied, a **final Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document is created. This document becomes the foundation for the actual system development.

Creating a prototype helps in understanding the customer‚Äôs needs more precisely and assists in developing the **actual design and architecture** of the final product.

---

## Types of Prototype Model

### 1. **Evolutionary Prototype**

- This type of prototype is **gradually refined and evolved** into the final product.
    
- It is **not discarded**; rather, it serves as the base upon which the final system is built.
    
- Useful when requirements are **incomplete or constantly changing**.
    
- Focuses on delivering a **working system** early and improves it with user feedback.
    

> ‚úÖ _Use Case:_ Long-term projects where requirements are expected to evolve.

---

### 2. **Throwaway (Rapid) Prototype**

- Also called **Rapid Prototyping**, this model creates a prototype **quickly** to understand user requirements.
    
- The prototype is built only to gather feedback and is **discarded after use**.
    
- The actual system is then developed from scratch based on the final, clarified requirements.
    

> ‚úÖ _Use Case:_ When the goal is to understand unclear or vague requirements quickly, without reusing the prototype code.

### Advantages

- Encourages **active user involvement** during early stages.
    
- Helps clarify **user requirements** and expectations.
    
- Provides **quick feedback** to developers, reducing the chances of software mismatches.
    
- Reduces the risk of **miscommunication** between client and developer.
    
### Disadvantages

- Customer demand can increase after seeing prototype asking for the product early.
    
- without proper management itreations can take lot of time
    
- if user is not satisfied the customer can lose intrest in the project

# Spiral Model

The **Spiral Model** was first introduced by **Barry Boehm in 1986**, and it emphasizes **risk management** at every phase of the software development lifecycle.  
It is a **combination of iterative development** and the **systematic aspects of the Waterfall Model**, with a strong focus on **risk assessment**.

In this model:

- The **radial dimension** represents the **cumulative cost** incurred so far.
    
- Each **loop** around the spiral indicates a **development phase**, and the path length represents the **cost of the phase**.
    
- The **angular dimension** (i.e., rotation from the starting point) represents the **progress** in completing each phase.
    

Each loop of the spiral (starting from the x-axis and moving **clockwise through 360¬∞**) represents one phase of the development process. Each phase is divided into **four major sectors**:

## üìê Sectors of the Spiral Model

1. **Determine Objectives and Plan the Next Phase**
    
    - Define goals, alternatives, and constraints.
        
    - Plan for the upcoming iteration.
        
2. **Risk Analysis**
    
    - Identify and analyze risks.
        
    - Explore ways to eliminate or mitigate the highest-risk elements.
        
3. **Engineering (Development and Testing)**
    
    - Actual development of the product: designing, coding, and testing.
        
4. **Customer Evaluation**
    
    - Review by the customer and validation of the deliverable.
        
    - Feedback is collected to refine objectives and plan the next iteration.
        

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages

- **Risk is explicitly assessed and managed** at every phase.
    
- Supports **early development of prototypes** for better customer feedback.
    
- Allows for **changes and refinements** at each loop.
    
- Suitable for **complex and high-risk projects**.
    
- Focuses on **continuous improvement** through iterative refinement.
    

---

## ‚ùå Disadvantages

- Can be **complex to manage and implement** due to its flexible and evolving nature.
    
- **Not suitable for small or low-risk projects** (overhead is too high).
    
- **Requires expertise in risk assessment** and project planning.
    
- Can be **expensive and time-consuming**, especially if too many iterations are involved.

# üì¶ Incremental Model

The **Incremental Model** is a software development approach where the product is designed, implemented, and tested **incrementally** (a little more is added each time) until the complete system is ready.

Instead of delivering the complete software at once, it is developed in **small, manageable parts (increments)**. Each increment adds **functional capabilities** to the previous version.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Characteristics

- Each increment is a **functional component** of the system.
    
- The first increment is often the **core product** with basic features.
    
- Subsequent increments **enhance or extend** the existing product.
    
- User feedback from each increment can influence future development.
    
- Can be used with **both linear and iterative approaches**.
    

---

## üîÅ Phases of the Incremental Model

1. **Requirements Analysis**
    
2. **Design of the Increment**
    
3. **Implementation and Testing**
    
4. **Integration with Previous Increments**
    
5. **User Evaluation and Feedback**
    
6. **Repeat Until Final Product is Complete**
    

---

## ‚úÖ Advantages

- **Faster delivery** of working software; early increments can be released and used.
    
- **Easier to test and debug**, since issues are confined to individual increments.
    
- Allows **partial implementation** of the system when full functionality is not yet known.
    
- **Customer feedback** can be incorporated early and frequently.
    
- **Low initial delivery cost** and reduced risk.
    
- Well-suited for projects with **clear high-priority features** needed early.
    

---

## ‚ùå Disadvantages

- **Requires good planning** and clear modular architecture to divide increments properly.
    
- Integration of increments may become **complex** as the number of increments increases.
    
- If requirements are **poorly understood**, initial increments may need rework.
    
- Not suitable for **tight-budget or low-resource** projects if ongoing development costs are high.
    
- **Incomplete system** in early phases may not be acceptable to all stakeholders.
