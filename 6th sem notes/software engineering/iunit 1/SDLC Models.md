# Waterfall Model

The **Waterfall Model** is the simplest Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model in which phases are organized in a **linear and sequential** manner.  
It is called the **Waterfall Model** because its diagrammatic representation resembles a waterfall. It is also known as the **Classical Life Cycle Model**.

This model is mainly used for **small to medium-sized projects** with **clear, well-defined requirements**, where the technology and tools to be used are **well-known and stable**.  
It is suitable for projects where **minimal changes are expected** during development and where **predictability** is prioritized.

### Advantages

- Easy to understand and implement, with well-defined stages and clear milestones.
    
- Each phase has a well-defined input and output; phases are processed and completed one at a time without overlap.
    
- Low cost and easy to schedule, as all team members are not required to work concurrentlyâ€”allowing them to work on multiple projects.

### Disadvantages

- Not suitable for accommodating changes or iterations once development has started.
    
- Difficult to gather complete and accurate requirements at the beginning.
    
- Working software is produced only at the final phase, making it unsuitable for **large, sophisticated projects**.
    
- High levels of risk and uncertainty.

# Prototype Model

In many cases, customers are **unsure about the exact functionality** they want in the software. As a result, the final product may not match their expectations.

The **Prototype Model** is an **iterative** approach that involves developing an **early working model** of the software with limited functionality, low reliability, and untrusted performance.  
The prototype is refined through **user feedback** and the process is repeated until a **satisfactory solution** is achieved.

Then shown to the user, as per the feedback of the user prototype is rebuilt and modified and again shown to the user, the process continue till the customer is not satisfied.

After this process the final SRS document is developed.

Developing the prototype help in building the actual design.

Prototype model is of two types
- Evolutionary prototype
- Throwaway prototype

Evolutionary prototype is bascially when we keep incrementing over the prototype showed to the customer and work on that particular prototype over and over in iterative

### Advantages

- Encourages **active user involvement** during early stages.
    
- Helps clarify **user requirements** and expectations.
    
- Provides **quick feedback** to developers, reducing the chances of software mismatches.
    
- Reduces the risk of **miscommunication** between client and developer.
