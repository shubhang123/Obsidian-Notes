# Waterfall Model

The **Waterfall Model** is the simplest Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model in which phases are organized in a **linear and sequential** manner.  
It is called the **Waterfall Model** because its diagrammatic representation resembles a waterfall. It is also known as the **Classical Life Cycle Model**.

This model is mainly used for **small to medium-sized projects** with **clear, well-defined requirements**, where the technology and tools to be used are **well-known and stable**.  
It is suitable for projects where **minimal changes are expected** during development and where **predictability** is prioritized.

### Advantages

- Easy to understand and implement, with well-defined stages and clear milestones.
    
- Each phase has a well-defined input and output; phases are processed and completed one at a time without overlap.
    
- Low cost and easy to schedule, as all team members are not required to work concurrently—allowing them to work on multiple projects.
    

---

### Disadvantages

- Not suitable for accommodating changes or iterations once development has started.
    
- Difficult to gather complete and accurate requirements at the beginning.
    
- Working software is produced only at the final phase, making it unsuitable for **large, sophisticated projects**.
    
- High levels of risk and uncertainty.

# Prototype Model

In many cases, customers are **unsure about the exact functionality** they want in the software. As a result, the final product may not match their expectations.

The **Prototype Model** is an **iterative** software development approach that involves building an **early working model** (prototype) of the system with **limited functionality**, **low reliability**, and **unverified performance**.

The prototype is then **shown to the user**, who provides feedback. Based on this feedback, the prototype is **modified and rebuilt**, and the updated version is again presented to the user. This **loop continues** until the customer is satisfied.

Once the prototype has been refined to the point where the user is satisfied, a **final Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** document is created. This document becomes the foundation for the actual system development.

Creating a prototype helps in understanding the customer’s needs more precisely and assists in developing the **actual design and architecture** of the final product.

## Types of Prototype Model

### 1. **Evolutionary Prototype**

- This type of prototype is **gradually refined and evolved** into the final product.
    
- It is **not discarded**; rather, it serves as the base upon which the final system is built.
    
- Useful when requirements are **incomplete or constantly changing**.
    
- Focuses on delivering a **working system** early and improves it with user feedback.
    

> ✅ _Use Case:_ Long-term projects where requirements are expected to evolve.

---

### 2. **Throwaway (Rapid) Prototype**

- Also called **Rapid Prototyping**, this model creates a prototype **quickly** to understand user requirements.
    
- The prototype is built only to gather feedback and is **discarded after use**.
    
- The actual system is then developed from scratch based on the final, clarified requirements.
    

> ✅ _Use Case:_ When the goal is to understand unclear or vague requirements quickly, without reusing the prototype code.

### Advantages

- Encourages **active user involvement** during early stages.
    
- Helps clarify **user requirements** and expectations.
    
- Provides **quick feedback** to developers, reducing the chances of software mismatches.
    
- Reduces the risk of **miscommunication** between client and developer.
    
### Disadvantages

- Customer demand can increase after seeing prototype asking for the product early.
    
- without proper management itreations can take lot of time
    
- if user is not satisfied the customer can lose intrest in the project


spiral model 
recogniziton of risk factiors in the cycle model presentaed in 1986 

radial dimensions o the model reporeetnt cumulative costs 
each path around the sipar is indicative of the increased cost
the angular dimensions represent the progress made in completing each cycle , each loop of trhe spiral from x axis colckwise through 360 represent one phase , which is divided into 4 sectors
