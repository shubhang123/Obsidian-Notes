# Waterfall Model
It is a simplest SDLC in which phases are organised in a linear and sequential order.
It is called waterfall model as its diagrammatic representation resembles as like a waterfall, also known as classical life cycle model.
This type of model is basically used for the Small to medium-sized projects with clear, well-defined requirements. When the technology and tools to be used are well-known and stable.
Projects where minimal changes are expected during the development process, and predictability is prioritized over

Advantage

Easy to understand and implement, with well-defined stages and clear milestones.
Each phase has well defined input and output, phases are processed and completed one at a time. Phases do not overlap.
Low cost and easy to schedule, as all staff
do not work concurrently on the same project, so can work on different projects.

Disadvantage
Not suitable to accommodate any change or iteration once development has begun. It is always difficult to acquire of the requirement in the starting.

Testing
Working version is produced in the last level, so not good for large size
sophisticated projects.
Maintenance
High amounts of risk and uncertainty.


# PROTOTYPE MODEL
Most of the customer are not sure about the functionality they require from the software, as a result the final s/w is not according to exact demand.
It is an iterative approach, which involves developing an early working model of the software based on the currently known requirements with limited functionalities, low reliability and untrusted performance.
Refining it through user feedback, and repeating the process until a satisfactory solution is achieved.
