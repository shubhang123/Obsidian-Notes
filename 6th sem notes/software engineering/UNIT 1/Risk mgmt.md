## üõ°Ô∏è Safety and Risk Assessment in Software Engineering

---

### üî∑ **Safety**

**Software safety** is a **software quality assurance activity** that focuses on:

- **Identifying and assessing potential hazards** in software
    
- Understanding how such hazards could cause **system-wide failure**
    
- Ensuring that **design features are specified early** to either **eliminate** or **control** these hazards
    

> Unlike **reliability**, which deals with the **likelihood of failure**, **safety** is concerned with **how failures can lead to catastrophic outcomes** (mishaps).

**Key Characteristics:**

- Software is analysed within the **context of the entire system** (e.g., hardware, human interactions, and environment).
    
- **Security** is considered a **prerequisite** for safety ‚Äî a vulnerable system is an unsafe system.
    
- **Example**: In a computer-based **cruise control** system:
    
    - Hazards may include **uncontrolled acceleration** or **failure to respond to the brake pedal**.

### üî∂ **Risk Assessment**

**Risk Assessment** is a key part of **risk management**, aimed at **understanding and managing uncertainty** in software projects.

#### üìå What is a Risk?

A **risk** is defined as a:

- **Potential problem**
    
- Characterised by **uncertainty**
    
- Accompanied by a possibility of **loss**

### üîé Steps in Risk Assessment:

---

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Identification**

- Systematically specify potential **threats** to the project or product.
    
- Risks may be:
    
    - **Known**
        
    - **Predictable**
        
    - **Unpredictable**
        
- Categorised as:
    
    - **Generic risks** ‚Äì affect all projects (e.g., staffing issues, unrealistic deadlines)
        
    - **Product-specific risks** ‚Äì unique to the software being developed
        

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Projection (Estimation)**

- Rate each risk based on:
    
    - **Likelihood (Probability)**
        
    - **Impact (Consequence)**
        
- Use a **risk table** to prioritise:
    
    - High-probability + High-impact risks are addressed first.
        
- Calculate **Risk Exposure (RE)**:
    
    Risk¬†Exposure¬†(RE)=Probability√óCost\text{Risk Exposure (RE)} = \text{Probability} \times \text{Cost}
- If **RE exceeds 50%** of the project‚Äôs estimated cost, the **project's viability must be re-evaluated**.
    

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Refinement**

- General risks are broken down into more detailed and manageable components.
    
- A common approach is using the **CTC format**:
    
    - **Condition**: Under what condition does the risk occur?
        
    - **Transition**: What causes the condition to become active?
        
    - **Consequence**: What is the result or loss if the risk occurs?
        

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Risk Mitigation, Monitoring, and Management (RMMM)**

- Develop a **comprehensive strategy** that includes:
    
    - **Risk avoidance** (change plans to prevent risk)
        
    - **Risk monitoring** (keep track of risk indicators)
        
    - **Contingency planning** (prepare fallback plans if the risk materialises)
        

---

#### üîê **Security Risk Analysis**

- A vital component of risk management
    
- Involves:
    
    - **Threat modelling** ‚Äì identifying and evaluating security threats
        
    - **Risk prioritisation** ‚Äì using metrics like **Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE)**
        
    - **Incident Response Plan (IRP)** ‚Äì outlining actions if a threat becomes real
