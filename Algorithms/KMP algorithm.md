The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is an efficient string-matching algorithm that finds all occurrences of a pattern within a given text. It was developed by Donald Knuth, Vaughan Pratt, and James H. Morris in 1970. Here’s a detailed overview of how it works, its components, and its complexity.

## Overview of KMP Algorithm

### Purpose
The KMP algorithm aims to solve the problem of finding all occurrences of a pattern $$ p $$ in a text $$ S $$ efficiently, avoiding unnecessary comparisons.

### How It Works
The KMP algorithm preprocesses the pattern to create a **Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS)** array (or prefix function), which is used to skip unnecessary comparisons in the text.

1. **LPS Array**: The LPS array stores the length of the longest proper prefix of the pattern that is also a suffix for each prefix of the pattern. This helps in determining how far to shift the pattern upon a mismatch.

2. **Searching Process**:
   - Initialize two pointers: one for the text and one for the pattern.
   - Compare characters of the text and pattern.
   - If there's a match, move both pointers forward.
   - If there's a mismatch after some matches, use the LPS array to skip unnecessary comparisons instead of starting from scratch.

### Steps Involved
1. **Preprocess the Pattern**: Compute the LPS array.
2. **Search in Text**: Use the LPS array while iterating through the text to find matches.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing Time**: The time complexity for computing the LPS array is $$ O(m) $$, where $$ m $$ is the length of the pattern.
- **Search Time**: The time complexity for searching through the text is $$ O(n) $$, where $$ n $$ is the length of the text.
- **Overall Complexity**: The total time complexity is $$ O(n + m) $$. This makes KMP significantly more efficient than naive string matching algorithms, which have a worst-case time complexity of $$ O(nm) $$.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is $$ O(m) $$ due to the storage required for the LPS array.

## Example Implementation

Here’s an example implementation of the KMP algorithm in C++:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

void computeLPSArray(const std::string& pattern, std::vector<int>& lps) {
    int m = pattern.length();
    int len = 0; // length of previous longest prefix suffix
    lps[0] = 0; // lps[0] is always 0

    int i = 1;
    while (i < m) {
        if (pattern[i] == pattern[len]) {
            len++;
            lps[i] = len;
            i++;
        } else {
            if (len != 0) {
                len = lps[len - 1]; // Use previous LPS value
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
}

void KMPSearch(const std::string& text, const std::string& pattern) {
    int n = text.length();
    int m = pattern.length();

    std::vector<int> lps(m);
    computeLPSArray(pattern, lps);

    int i = 0; // index for text
    int j = 0; // index for pattern
    while (i < n) {
        if (pattern[j] == text[i]) {
            i++;
            j++;
        }

        if (j == m) {
            std::cout << "Pattern found at index " << (i - j) << std::endl;
            j = lps[j - 1]; // Use LPS to continue searching
        } else if (i < n && pattern[j] != text[i]) {
            if (j != 0)
                j = lps[j - 1]; // Use previous LPS value
            else
                i++;
        }
    }
}

int main() {
    std::string text = "ABCABCDABCDABDE";
    std::string pattern = "ABCD";

    KMPSearch(text, pattern);

    return 0;
}
```

### Output
```
Pattern found at index 3
Pattern found at index 10
```

## Conclusion

The KMP algorithm is an efficient solution for string matching problems, providing linear time complexity by avoiding redundant comparisons through its clever use of preprocessing with the LPS array. This makes it particularly useful in applications requiring fast string searches, such as search engines, text editors, and DNA sequence analysis.
