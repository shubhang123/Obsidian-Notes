**Provider Payment & Catalogue Systems**

**Wellness Forever**
Uses a cash-on-delivery model with wallet integration. When an order is placed, the system checks the customer's wallet balance. If the wallet covers the full amount, payment is processed from the wallet. If there's insufficient balance, the remaining amount is collected by the delivery person upon delivery. Wellness Forever provides their complete product catalogue for integration.

**TATA 1mg** 
Operates on a direct payment model where we handle all payment processing on our platform before order fulfillment. Customers pay upfront through our system, and we manage the complete transaction flow. TATA 1mg also provides their full product catalogue for our platform.

**Evital**
Evital doesnt give us their catalogue, they give us the search api , we have to search there if the steerage selects the provider as evital, otherwise HRX search is used.

**Upcoming Providers**
We're in the process of onboarding two additional providers - Medpay and Apollo Pharmacy - which will expand our network and provide customers with more options for healthcare products and services.

This multi-provider approach gives us flexibility in payment processing while ensuring comprehensive product availability across different pharmacy networks.
