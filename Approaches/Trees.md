## Introduction to Trees

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Unlike linear data structures (like arrays or linked lists), trees allow for a branching structure. The most common type of tree is the **binary tree**, where each node has at most two children (typically referred to as the left and right child). Other types of trees include binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and more.

---

## Tree Representations and Terminology

### Basic Terminology:

- **Node:** The fundamental unit that contains data.
- **Root:** The topmost node in a tree.
- **Child:** A node that descends from another node.
- **Parent:** A node that has one or more children.
- **Leaf:** A node with no children.
- **Subtree:** A tree consisting of a node and its descendants.
- **Height/Depth:** The number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf.

### Representations:

1. **Node-based Structure:**  
    Each node is typically defined using a structure or class that contains the node's value and pointers (or references) to its children. For example, a binary tree node is often represented as follows:
    
    ```cpp
    struct TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode* left;
        TreeNode* right;
        TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
    };
    ```
    
2. **Array-based Representation (Heap):**  
    Complete binary trees can be represented using arrays, where for any index ii:
    
    - Left child is at index 2i+12i + 1
    - Right child is at index 2i+22i + 2

## Common Tree Traversals

Traversals are methods to visit all nodes in a tree. There are two major categories: depth-first and breadth-first.

### Recursive Traversals

1. **Preorder Traversal:** Visit the current node, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
    
    ```cpp
    void preorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return;
        cout << root->val << " ";
        preorder(root->left);
        preorder(root->right);
    }
    ```
    
2. **Inorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the current node, and finally the right subtree.
    
    ```cpp
    void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return;
        inorder(root->left);
        cout << root->val << " ";
        inorder(root->right);
    }
    ```
    
3. **Postorder Traversal:** Visit the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the current node.
    
    ```cpp
    void postorder(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return;
        postorder(root->left);
        postorder(root->right);
        cout << root->val << " ";
    }
    ```
    

### Iterative Traversals

Sometimes an iterative approach is preferred to avoid deep recursion (and potential stack overflow):

- **Iterative Inorder Traversal:** Using an explicit stack.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <stack>
    void inorderIterative(TreeNode* root) {
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        TreeNode* curr = root;
        while (curr || !s.empty()) {
            while (curr) {
                s.push(curr);
                curr = curr->left;
            }
            curr = s.top();
            s.pop();
            cout << curr->val << " ";
            curr = curr->right;
        }
    }
    ```
    
- **Iterative Preorder Traversal:** Also using a stack.
    
    ```cpp
    #include <stack>
    void preorderIterative(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return;
        stack<TreeNode*> s;
        s.push(root);
        while (!s.empty()) {
            TreeNode* curr = s.top();
            s.pop();
            cout << curr->val << " ";
            if (curr->right) s.push(curr->right);
            if (curr->left) s.push(curr->left);
        }
    }
    ```

## Building and Manipulating Trees

Building trees often involves either manual creation or constructing a tree from given data (such as arrays or input sequences). For example, to build a binary tree manually:

```cpp
TreeNode* buildSampleTree() {
    // Constructing the following tree:
    //       1
    //      / \
    //     2   3
    //    / \   \
    //   4   5   6
    TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(1);
    root->left = new TreeNode(2);
    root->right = new TreeNode(3);
    root->left->left = new TreeNode(4);
    root->left->right = new TreeNode(5);
    root->right->right = new TreeNode(6);
    return root;
}
```

Manipulating trees can include operations like inserting or deleting nodes in binary search trees, balancing trees, and more.

## Detailed Tree Problems and Examples

### Binary Tree Traversals (Preorder, Inorder, Postorder)

**Example:** Perform all three traversals on a given binary tree.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

struct TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode* left;
    TreeNode* right;
    TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(nullptr), right(nullptr) {}
};

void preorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    cout << root->val << " ";
    preorder(root->left);
    preorder(root->right);
}

void inorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    inorder(root->left);
    cout << root->val << " ";
    inorder(root->right);
}

void postorder(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return;
    postorder(root->left);
    postorder(root->right);
    cout << root->val << " ";
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = buildSampleTree(); // See the buildSampleTree() function above.
    
    cout << "Preorder: ";
    preorder(root);
    cout << "\nInorder: ";
    inorder(root);
    cout << "\nPostorder: ";
    postorder(root);
    cout << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

### Level Order Traversal (BFS for Trees)

**Example:** Traverse a binary tree level by level.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
using namespace std;

vector<vector<int>> levelOrder(TreeNode* root) {
    vector<vector<int>> result;
    if (!root) return result;
    queue<TreeNode*> q;
    q.push(root);
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int levelSize = q.size();
        vector<int> currentLevel;
        for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            TreeNode* node = q.front();
            q.pop();
            currentLevel.push_back(node->val);
            if (node->left) q.push(node->left);
            if (node->right) q.push(node->right);
        }
        result.push_back(currentLevel);
    }
    return result;
}

int main() {
    TreeNode* root = buildSampleTree();
    vector<vector<int>> levels = levelOrder(root);
    cout << "Level order traversal:" << endl;
    for (const auto &level : levels) {
        for (int val : level)
            cout << val << " ";
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)

**Problem Statement:**  
Given a binary tree and two nodes, find their lowest common ancestor.

**Recursive Approach:**  
If the current node is one of the target nodes, return it. Otherwise, search in the left and right subtrees. If both calls return non-null, the current node is the LCA.

```cpp
TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
    if (!root || root == p || root == q)
        return root;
    
    TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
    TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);
    
    if (left && right)
        return root;
    return left ? left : right;
}
```

### Diameter of a Binary Tree

**Problem Statement:**  
Find the diameter (the length of the longest path between any two nodes) in a binary tree.

**Approach:**  
The diameter can be computed at each node as the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees. Use recursion to compute both height and diameter.

```cpp
#include <algorithm>
int diameter = 0;

int height(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root)
        return 0;
    int leftHeight = height(root->left);
    int rightHeight = height(root->right);
    // Update diameter at each node.
    diameter = max(diameter, leftHeight + rightHeight);
    return max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
}

int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
    diameter = 0;
    height(root);
    return diameter;
}
```

## Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

- **Memory Management:**  
    When dynamically allocating nodes (using `new`), ensure you properly delete nodes to avoid memory leaks. Consider using smart pointers (like `std::unique_ptr`) in modern C++.
    
- **Recursive Depth:**  
    Deep trees can cause stack overflow. For very large trees, consider iterative traversals or tail recursion (if applicable).
    
- **Edge Cases:**  
    Always test with an empty tree, a tree with one node, and unbalanced trees.
    
- **Clear Definitions:**  
    Understand the tree type you are working with (binary tree, BST, AVL, etc.) as operations can vary significantly.
