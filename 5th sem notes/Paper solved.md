**1.b) Explain the pros and cons of DHCP and ICMP.**  
_(7 marks)_

### **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration parameters (subnet mask, gateway, DNS) to devices on a network.

**Pros**

1. **Automation**: Reduces manual IP configuration tasks and associated errors.
2. **Efficient IP Management**: Recycles IP addresses when devices leave the network.
3. **Scalability**: Ideal for large networks (corporate LANs, ISPs).

**Cons**

1. **Dependency on DHCP Server**: If the DHCP server fails or is unreachable, new devices can’t obtain valid IPs.
2. **Security Risks**: Rogue DHCP servers can hand out incorrect settings (e.g., malicious gateways).
3. **Limited Control**: Administrators rely on the DHCP server’s lease policies, though reservations can mitigate this.

### **ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)**

- **Purpose**: Used for error reporting and diagnostics (e.g., `ping`, `traceroute`).

**Pros**

1. **Troubleshooting**: Tools like `ping` and `traceroute` identify connectivity and routing issues.
2. **Error Reporting**: Informs senders about unreachable destinations, time-to-live exceeded, etc.
3. **Lightweight**: Integral part of IP for basic network-layer debugging.

**Cons**

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Attackers can exploit ICMP (e.g., Smurf attacks, ping floods) to launch denial-of-service.
2. **Limited Payload**: Only for control messages and error reporting, not for actual data transfer.
3. **Filtering in Firewalls**: Many networks block certain ICMP types, complicating diagnostics.

# **Question 2**

**2.a) Discuss about Web Application Architecture with a neat sketch.**  
_(7 marks)_

A typical **Web Application Architecture** organizes an application into **layers** or **tiers**, ensuring separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability. A common model:

1. **Presentation (Client) Layer**
    
    - The front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript running in the user’s browser.
    - Communicates with the server over HTTP/HTTPS.
2. **Application (Logic) Layer**
    
    - Server-side logic: frameworks in **Java (Spring), .NET, PHP, Node.js**, etc.
    - Manages business rules, handles requests, orchestrates data from databases.
3. **Data Layer**
    
    - **Database servers** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) store user data, product catalogs, transactions.
    - This layer is accessed via queries or an ORM (Object Relational Mapping).

A **simplified sketch**:

```
   [Client/Browser]   --(HTTP/HTTPS)-->  [Web Server + Application Logic]  --(SQL/NoSQL)-->  [Database]
         ↑                                          |
         |---------------(Responses)----------------|
```

- **Three-Tier** or **N-Tier** approaches are common, sometimes adding caching layers (Redis), microservices, load balancers, or content delivery networks (CDNs) for larger applications.

**2.b) What is a Servlet? How to create a web application with Servlets?**  
_(7 marks)_

### **Servlet Definition**

- A **Servlet** is a Java class that runs on a server (within a Servlet container like Apache Tomcat) and handles HTTP requests/responses. It’s part of **Java EE (Jakarta EE)** technology for building dynamic web applications.

### **Key Points**

1. **Lifecycle Methods**: `init()`, `service()`, `doGet()/doPost()`, `destroy()`.
2. **Platform Independence**: Written once in Java, runs on any compliant servlet container.
3. **Session Handling**: Built-in support via `HttpSession`.

### **Steps to Create a Web App with Servlets**

1. **Setup**: Install/Configure a Servlet Container (e.g., Tomcat).
2. **Project Structure**:
    - `WEB-INF/` folder to store deployment descriptor (`web.xml`) and classes.
    - `src/` for Java source code (Servlet classes).
3. **Write the Servlet Class**:
    
    ```java
    @WebServlet("/hello")
    public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
        protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
            throws ServletException, IOException {
            response.setContentType("text/html");
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
            out.println("<h1>Hello from Servlet!</h1>");
        }
    }
    ```
    
4. **Compile & Package**: Package into a `.war` file or place classes in `WEB-INF/classes`.
5. **Deploy**: Copy the `.war` or directory to the `webapps/` folder of Tomcat (or another server).
6. **Access**: Browse to `http://localhost:8080/YourAppName/hello` to see the servlet response.

Servlets often combine with **JSP** and frameworks (like Spring MVC) for a more structured application.
