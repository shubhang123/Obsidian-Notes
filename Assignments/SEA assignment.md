## 1. How Reverse Engineering assists in recovering lost information? Explain the concept of Reverse Engineering with defined goals. Mention a few reverse engineering tools.

Reverse Engineering is the process of analyzing software, hardware, or systems to understand their components and functions, often in order to recover lost or hidden information, reconstruct lost data, or create a copy of a system for analysis.
	•	Goals of Reverse Engineering:
	1.	Recovery of lost information: It helps recover the original source code or design specifications of software when original documentation or source code is lost or corrupted.
	2.	Understanding system components: It aids in analyzing and understanding the structure, behavior, and functionality of software or hardware.
	3.	Interoperability and compatibility: By reverse-engineering an existing system, developers can create compatible systems, or find ways to integrate different systems.
	4.	Security analysis: Reverse engineering can be used to identify vulnerabilities, potential exploits, and weaknesses in a system.
	5.	Software maintenance: It helps maintain and upgrade systems by providing an understanding of legacy code.

Tools for Reverse Engineering:
	•	IDA Pro: A popular disassembler used for reverse-engineering software.
	•	Ghidra: A free and open-source tool developed by the NSA for software reverse engineering.
	•	OllyDbg: A debugger that assists in analyzing executable programs.
	•	Radare2: A framework for reverse engineering and analyzing binaries.

## 2. How to quantitatively express the reliability of the software product using reliability metrics?

Reliability metrics provide quantitative measures of a software product’s dependability and performance under normal or expected conditions. Here are some common metrics used to express reliability:
	1.	Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF):
	•	Represents the average time between system failures.
	•	A higher MTBF indicates a more reliable system.
	2.	Failure Rate:
	•	The rate at which software defects or failures occur over time.
	•	It is often expressed as the number of failures per unit of time or usage.
	3.	Mean Time to Repair (MTTR):
	•	The average time taken to fix a failure or defect in the system.
	•	A lower MTTR indicates better reliability.
	4.	Defect Density:
	•	The number of defects per unit of software size (e.g., defects per 1000 lines of code).
	•	A lower defect density implies higher reliability.
	5.	Availability:
	•	It is the percentage of time the software is operational and not down for maintenance or failures.
	•	Expressed as: \text{Availability} = \frac{\text{MTBF}}{\text{MTBF} + \text{MTTR}}

### 3. “Software quality metrics are a subset of software metrics that focus on the quality aspects of the product, process, and project.” Justify the role of Quality metrics in software development.

Role of Quality Metrics in Software Development:
	1.	Measuring and Ensuring Product Quality:
	•	Quality metrics help in evaluating the functional and non-functional aspects of a product (e.g., performance, security, usability).
	•	They ensure the product meets the required quality standards and specifications.
	2.	Continuous Improvement:
	•	By tracking metrics over time, teams can identify areas where the software quality can be improved and adjust their processes accordingly.
	•	For example, if the defect density is high, the team might focus more on testing or refactoring code.
	3.	Predicting Software Behavior:
	•	Quality metrics such as code complexity, coupling, and cohesion provide insights into the maintainability and reliability of the software.
	•	Predictive metrics like defect arrival rate can help anticipate future defects.
	4.	Project Management and Control:
	•	Metrics help managers in decision-making by providing clear, objective data about the quality of the software and the progress of the project.
	•	They allow for better resource allocation, risk management, and scheduling.
	5.	Customer Satisfaction:
	•	By ensuring high-quality standards through metrics, software developers can deliver products that meet user expectations and requirements, thus enhancing customer satisfaction.

## 4. What is the “40-20-40 rule” for Project Effort Distribution in Project Scheduling? Explain Software Project Scheduling Principles.

40-20-40 Rule:
	•	The “40-20-40” rule is a heuristic for project effort distribution during the software development life cycle:
	•	40% of the effort should be spent on the Analysis and Design phase, which involves gathering requirements and defining the system architecture.
	•	20% of the effort should be spent on the Coding phase, where the actual development takes place.
	•	40% of the effort should be spent on Testing and Maintenance, which involves debugging, validating the system, and addressing future updates or fixes.

Software Project Scheduling Principles:
	1.	Task Breakdown:
	•	Break the project into smaller, manageable tasks or work packages.
	2.	Prioritization:
	•	Identify the critical path and prioritize tasks that directly affect the project timeline.
	3.	Resource Allocation:
	•	Ensure that the necessary resources (team members, tools, equipment) are available and allocated properly to tasks.
	4.	Time Estimation:
	•	Make accurate time estimates for each task based on historical data and expertise.
	5.	Buffer Time:
	•	Include buffer time in the schedule to account for uncertainties and unforeseen delays.
	6.	Milestones:
	•	Establish clear milestones and checkpoints to monitor the progress of the project.
	7.	Flexibility and Adaptability:
	•	Ensure that the schedule is flexible enough to adapt to changes or new requirements that may arise during the project.
	8.	Communication:
	•	Ensure regular communication between stakeholders to update on progress, risks, and adjustments needed.
