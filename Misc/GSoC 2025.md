### Porting Open Prices Features to the Open Food Facts Mobile App

#### Description

This project aims to integrate the core features of Open Prices into the Open Food Facts mobile application. Open Prices allows users to contribute and view price information for products, creating a valuable resource for consumers. Currently, this functionality is primarily available on the Open Prices website. Bringing Open Prices to the mobile app will significantly increase accessibility and user engagement, leveraging the app's existing user base. This will empower users to easily compare prices while shopping, contribute new price data on-the-go. The project will focus on seamlessly integrating these features into the existing app structure, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.

#### Expected outcomes

- Beautify the current user Interface and review the current user Experience (UI/UX) for existing flows: Prioritize a user-friendly and intuitive interface for both viewing and contributing price data, adhering to mobile design best practices.
- Price Viewing: Implement the ability to browse and search for product prices within the Open Food Facts mobile app. This should include clear display of current and historical prices, potentially with visualizations (e.g., price trends).
- Bulk Price Contribution using Artificial Intelligence: Enable users to easily add new bulk price information for products directly through the app. This should include mechanisms for data validation and image uploads for price verification.
- Offline Functionality: Add offline price contribution (data synced when a connection is available) using the current background task system

# DocPilot

### Project Type: Large

## Description:

Build a new age EMR application using conversational AI at its best. Existing EMR solutioning is Age-old! Doctors resist the overwhelming software which is high on costs and difficult to operate. Last innovation was made in 1990's. DocPilot listens to the whole consultation conversation between a doctor and patient, and generates a prescription for the doctor to just sign, print and save digitally.

The app should be able to separate out things like symptoms, diagnosis, medications and tests from the conversation it listens to. These are just the basic requirements. Research more on OPD appointments and include them in our solutioning.

## Expected Outcomes:

- Conversational AI-powered EMR that listens and auto-generates prescriptions.
- Eliminates outdated, complex, and costly software for doctors.
- Affordable and easy to use, reducing resistance from medical professionals.
- Extracts symptoms, diagnosis, medications, and tests from conversations.
- Allows doctors to review, sign, print, and save prescriptions digitally.
- Integrates OPD appointment management for a seamless experience.
- A modern solution replacing decades-old EMR systems.

# Extend the app to support more torrent clients

**Deluge**

[Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) is a popular BitTorrent client. It's popular because it's quite efficient and performs really well compared to alternatives, but its web interface is terrible and the desktop UI is not great.

However it does have a good plugin system and writing proper alternatives with Flutter is possible and not painful, so let's go for it.

The goal is to write a flutter-based interface (web and mobile).

Start by installing deluge and its current web UI so get a feeling of how it looks like, and come up with a good replacement UI.

Read the documentation to find out which part of Deluge don't yet have a UI counterpart at all.

**Flood**

[Flood](https://flood.js.org/) is a monitoring service for various torrent clients. It's a Node.js service that communicates with your a torrent client and serves a decent web UI (in React) for administration.

Flood backend can communicate with different clients. However, it exposes one common set of API. This allows developers of an integration to support multiple torrent clients via Flood's API. On the other hand, Flood allows developers of a torrent client to quickly set up a functional UI and get supported by integrations.

Additionally, Flood supports advanced features like filesystem browsing, content streaming and RSS.

Flood's API is well documented and typed. It uses simple HTTP and JSON. For instance, see [POST /api/torrents/add-urls endpoint](https://github.com/jesec/flood/blob/9283a1d32db5592e004f52f98c9dffdc4e7bb85a/server/routes/api/torrents.ts#L107) and [AddTorrentByFileOptions type](https://github.com/jesec/flood/blob/d84c8aacb879d01c0e3eafeb87d3a5dfa73340fe/shared/schema/api/torrents.ts#L10).

Head maintainer of Flood, [jesec](https://github.com/jesec), is one of the mentors. He can provide help if you have troubles setting up Flood or encountered issues with Flood's API.

**Your job**

The job is to extend Flutter app to support Deluge and/or Flood.

You should work with your peer, whose goal may be different from yours, to find a way to support multiple API integrations in one application. You can check out how Flood did it.
